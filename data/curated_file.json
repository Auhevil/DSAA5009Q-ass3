    "input": " How do I know if my relationship is healthy?",
    "output": "It is important to understand that there is no \"one size fits all\" answer to your question. Every relationship is different, and there is no single way to define a \"healthy\" relationship.\n\nThat said, there are some general guidelines that you can use. One of the most important things to remember is that a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being yourself, and you should feel that your partner respects and values you as a person.\n\nAnother important aspect of a healthy relationship is honesty. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being open and honest with your partner. Your partner should feel the same way towards you. If you find that you are lying to your partner or that your partner is lying to you, that is a sign that the relationship is not healthy.\n\nIn addition, equality is also an important aspect of a healthy relationship. In a healthy relationship, neither partner should feel that they are \"superior\" to the other, and neither should feel like they are \"inferior\". The relationship should be equal in every way.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that a healthy relationship takes work. You shouldn't expect a healthy relationship to be perfect. You will have arguments and disagreements just like any other couple, but how you deal with those disagreements is what makes the relationship healthy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to know if your relationship is healthy is to ask yourself if you feel comfortable being yourself around your partner, if you feel like your partner respects you, if you feel like your partner is honest with you, if you feel like your partner is equal to you, and if you feel like you can talk to your partner about anything. If you can answer yes to all of those questions, then your relationship is probably healthy."

That's a total of 96 megabytes of reads and 32 megabytes of writes.\n\nThus there's twice as much memory traffic involved in computing this as $(A+B)v$ instead of $Av+Bv$.\n\nNote that if you have to do many of these multiplications with different vectors $v$ but the same $A$ and $B$, then it will become more efficient to compute $A+B$ once and reuse that matrix for the matrix-vector multiplications.

    "input": " I am an AI assistant. I am here to help you teach a child how to use scissors.",
    "output": "Most children around age 2 or 3 are ready to begin using scissors. It's important for children to know how to be safe with scissors. Once they're ready, using scissors can be an excellent way for the child to build fine motor skills and patience.\n\n## Prepare to teach\n\n1. Try fine motor skill activities to prepare the child for using scissors. Children need to build fine motor skills before they're ready to use scissors. Here are some activities that can help build the child's skills, and help you know if the child is ready:\n\t* Precision: Squeezing watercolor paint from an eyedropper onto paper, playing with finger puppets\n\t* \n\t* Bilateral coordination: Tearing up paper from the recycling bin\n\t* \n\t* Finger and hand strength: Spinning a top, punching holes with a hole punch, playing with squirt guns, using clothes pins\n2. Evaluate the child's ability to follow directions. The child should be able to follow instructions like \"stop\" or \"put it down, please.\" If a child isn't able to follow safety rules, then they shouldn't be given anything dangerous.\n3. Choose the right pair of scissors. Safety scissors are ideal for young children. Choose right-handed or left-handed scissors based on your child's dominant hand.\n4. Know that most kids are ready to use scissors around the age of 2 or 3. Many young children are able to use scissors.Talk to an occupational therapist if you think your child is struggling or has a disability that might delay their learning to use scissors. There are adaptive scissors for kids with disabilities, and special techniques to help kids who struggle with scissors. A delay isn't the end of the world. It just means things will happen a little differently.\n\n\n## Teach how to use scissor\n\n1. Let the child see you use a scissors. Show them how you do it, and let them watch. If they're curious, then you'll know they're most likely ready to learn.\n2. Start with the grip. Show the child in your hand how to hold the scissors, and then have them try to copy it. If they aren't able to alone, help move their fingers and thumb into the right position. Teach them that the thumb always goes in the hole. Draw an eyeball on the small thumb hole and explain that the eyeball will always be on top. Teach them that two fingers in the larger hole. Help them put their index finger and their middle finger in the hole.\n3. Have the child practice opening and closing the scissors. This practice will help the child build up the strength to control the scissors.\n4. Try having the child do their best to cut in a line or other shapes. Try drawing lines or shapes for the child to cut. After they do it, praise them. (Keep in mind that they may not be very precise yet; they're still young.)\n5. Find ways to make it fun. Let the child be creative. Try letting them cut colored paper, yarn, and other materials. Using scissors can be another way the child works on expressing themselves (all while building essential motor skills).\n6. Practice with the child how to turn the paper with one hand and cut with the other. This will prevent the child from turning the scissors up side down. Show the how to move the paper along with shuffling motions so that they maintain control of both the paper and the scissors.\n\n\n## Teach scissor safety\n\n1. Tell the child that scissors can hurt people if misused. It helps if kids don't just know what the rules are, but if they know why the rules are important. Explain that using scissors the wrong way can result in somebody getting hurt, and that's why the rules matter. Tell them that as long as they are following the rules, they don't have to worry.\n2. Explain that scissors are only for cutting paper. Fingers, hair, clothing, crayons, and other things are off-limits. If you decide to have the child practice with cutting Play Doh first, you can say that scissors are only for paper and Play Doh.If the child asks about why scissors are used for haircuts, explain \"Only adults can use scissors to cut hair, because they have more practice to make sure they don't mess up. Some adults go to a hair cutting school to learn how to do it right, and once they go there, they're allowed to cut hair.\"\n3. Explain that you need to walk carefully with scissors, if at all. Scissors can hurt people, so it's important to be careful. Some adults forbid walking with scissors at all, while others allow children to do it if the kids are careful. The best way to walk with scissors is to hold the closed blades in the fist. Walking this way reduces the risk of the child playing with the blades while walking, or falling and hurting themselves on the blades. Explain that running with scissors is extremely dangerous. If the child is going too fast, say \"Walking feet\" to remind them to slow down. Take away the scissors if they continue behaving dangerously.\n4. Take away the scissors if the child doesn't follow the rules. Give a reminder, and see if the child listens. If not, then you may decide to take away scissor privileges until the child is ready for another chance. Safety comes first.\n"

    "input": " I am an AI assistant. I can help you with any task. Please ask me anything.",
    "output": "Above ground pools are a modern, easy-to-install alternative to traditional underground pools. If you want to blend your above ground pool in with the rest of your yard, decorating it is a great way to start. With a few natural and practical decorations, like plants or a pool chairs, you can make your above ground pool a stylish part of your backyard. For siding options, you can install a deck, concrete or wood paneling, or glass panels.\n\n## Add natural decorations\n\n1. Set up potted plants as botanical decorations. Adding potted plants around your above ground pool can help it blend in with the rest of your backyard. If you install a deck, position a few potted plants around the sides or around the bottom of the pool. You can also grow trees or shrubs around the above ground pool as a long-term alternative.\n2. Add tiki torches to brighten up the area surrounding your pool. Tiki torches are a popular way to give your above ground pool an outdoorsy touch. Stake the tiki torches in the ground surrounding the pool at an even distance from each other, positioning them upright to prevent them from tilting. You can buy tiki torches online, from a garden center, or at many home improvement stores. String lights around the tiki torches for cheap and stylish lighting while swimming at night.\n3. Use straw bales if you want a rustic siding. Straw bales can make a cheap, natural siding for above ground pools. Stack the straw bales around the sides to approximately halfway up the above ground pool's height to use as a decoration and partial step into the pool. You can buy straw bales from some agricultural supply stores or plant nurseries. To keep the straw out of the pool, do not stack the straw bales to the full height of the pool.\n\n\n## Choose practical decorations\n\n1. Set up a cover to use as shade. Put up an umbrella, trellis, or pergola over the pool during summer months or in hot, sunny climates. If you have any naturally shady areas in your yard, construct the pool near these areas as an alternative. A cover decoration can help keep your pool cooler and prevent those who use it from getting sunburned.\n2. Add cushions or chairs as seating near the pool. Seats are perfect for tired swimmers who need a quick rest. Set up a few lawn chairs, waterproof cushions, hammocks, or other seats below the pool or on the deck (if applicable) for easy access after you swim. You can buy pool chairs from some home decor stores or online.\n3. Put up a foldable cover over the top to keep your pool safe and clean. To prevent debris from getting inside the pool and accidents with children or pets, buy a foldable pool cover online or from a pool supply store. Use the foldable cover overnight or while going on vacations where you won't be able to routinely clean the pool. Pool covers are also useful during winter or off-season months if you don't want to drain it.\n4. Install a table near your pool for towels, snacks, and drinks. If you use your pool for lounging, use a table as a makeshift \"poolside bar\" or coffee table. Set the table up near the edge of your pool or deck, depending on your pool's siding. Unless you set your table up on the deck, choose a table with a similar height as your above ground pool.\n5. Set up lights or heat lamps around the pool for added illumination and warmth. If you plan to use your pool at night, position a few outdoor lamps surrounding the pool. For those in cold climates or who use their pool in the winter, choose heat lamps to stay warm while swimming.\n6. Fence your pool in to separate it from the rest of your yard. A fence can help your pool feel enclosed and keep pets or young children out. Measure the perimeter of your yard and put up a fence around the entire area with a gate near the entrance.\n\n\n## Build deck and side\n\n1. Install a deck around your pool's side for a more finished look. To help your pool blend in with the surrounding backyard, build a deck around the sides that is approximately level with the pool. You can build the deck yourself or hire a contractor to build it for you. Building a deck around the pool is the best way to give it the appearance of an underground pool. If you prefer, you can install a deck with wide sides around the above ground pool and set up chairs or other pool furniture\n2. Set up concrete siding around the pool to secure it in place. For a more urban look, mix a batch of concrete and set up a wall on each side of the pool. If you have experience working with concrete, you can do it yourself. If not, you can hire a landscaper instead. Concrete is sturdy and more weather-resistant than wood but isn't as natural looking.\n3. Try wood paneling as a simpler alternative to building a deck. If you like the rustic look of decks but don't want to commit to the cost or time, line up wood panels around the sides of the pool. Secure the panels in place with an outdoor wood adhesive and apply a sealant to protect it from UV rays and harsh weather. For water-resistant wood stains, try polyurethane varnish, exterior paint, or Danish oil. Wood paneling can give the above ground pool a more finished appearance without as much construction as decks.\n4. Set up glass panes around the edges for a finished look. To give your above ground pool a look similar to a below ground pool, try setting up glass paneling. Buy or cut glass panes the approximate width of your above ground pool and hire a contractor to fix them on top of the siding. Setting up glass panels works best with deck siding.\n"

    "input": " How do you flip someone off?",
    "output": "Flipping someone off is a classic nonverbal signal for showing anger and frustration toward a person. You might \"flip the bird\" to someone who has cut you off, insulted you, or otherwise provoked your ire. At its simplest, flipping someone off is just pointedly displaying your middle finger in their direction. More advanced techniques take on an element of comedy or performance art. Remember: when you flip someone off, you are calling him or her out â so use with caution, or be prepared for the consequences!\n\n## Basic flip-off move\n\n1. Give someone the finger. There is a simple straightforwardness to the classic \"flip-off.\" Turn the back of your fist toward someone, as though you are shaking a fist at them. Then, extend your middle finger. Hold the pose and look the person in the eye. This is a quick and easy way to get the point across. Wave your finger around for emphasis. Hold it out firmly and emphatically to make sure that you get the point across.\n2. Try using both hands. For added effect, whip out the \"double-finger\" flip-off. Flip the person off with both middle fingers at the same to show them that you are unusually angry. Do \"the X\": cross your middle fingers into an \"X,\" and then hold them against your chest facing the offender.\n3. Switch fingers. For a somewhat more dynamic insult, flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession. Alternately, keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis.\n\n\n## Discreet flip-off move\n\n1. Act like you are itching your nose. Reach up to your face as though you are going to itch your nose or your face. Look in the direction of the person that you want to flip off. Then, use your middle finger to scratch your nose while staring pointedly. The person that you are flipping off might not notice this move. However, it might give other onlookers a laugh.\n2. Flip the person off behind their back. You might feel a bit better simply by releasing your anger somehow, even if the person in question doesn't actually see you. Consider whether you want to provoke a confrontation, or just get your feelings out.\n\n\n## Theatrical flip-off move\n\n1. Do the \"jack-in-the-box\" flip-off. Hold your fist out in front of you, knuckles facing the offender â but do not raise your middle finger yet. Then, make a fist with the other hand, and crank it in circles next to the first hand as though you are winding up an old-timey jack-in-the-box toy. As you crank, hum \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" the tune traditionally associated with jack-in-the-boxes. Hum and crank faster and faster as you approach the end of the tune. Then, at the final \"Pop\" of the \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" tune, extend your middle finger as though it is the jack popping out of the box. Finish humming the tune while flipping the person off. Make sure that you have the person's undivided attention. This move takes a bit of time to pull off, and you want to make sure to get the full effect.\n2. Practice \"the balloon.\" Hold your fist in front of your face and put the tip of your thumb in your mouth. Act as though you are blowing up a balloon: \"blow\" into your thumb, and slowly extend all of your fingers as though your breath is inflating them. Then, hold you middle finger of the \"balloon hand\" with your other hand, and move the thumb away from your mouth. Slowly close the other fingers on your \"balloon hand\" until only your middle finger is left pointing at the person whom you want to flip off.\n3. Pretend to \"find\" your middle finger. Act as though you are looking for something: in your pocket, or between the couch cushions, or in a desk drawer. Make sure that you get the person's attention. Then, make a show of being relieved that you have found the thing you're looking for. Turn to show the person what you found: and flip them off! Alternately, lean down in front of the person as though you are picking something up off of the ground. Come up flashing your middle finger, and say, \"Did you drop this?\"\n4. Try \"the trumpet.\" Blow on your thumb while pretending to play the trumpet, and flail your fingers as though you are hitting the valves. Periodically hold up only your middle finger. Add some musical effects for style!\n5. Try the \"double extreme.\" Extend the middle fingers of both hands. Then, bring your arms behind your back and through your legs. You should have both middle fingers clearly presented. Note: only people with long arms can pull this off.\n"

    "input": " Write a review of Mazur's paper on the Tate-Shafarevich group.",
    "output": "First, Mazur's paper is arguably the first paper where the new ideas (and language) of the Grothendieck revolution in algebraic geometry were fully embraced and crucially used in pure number theory.  Here are several notable examples: Mazur makes crucial use of the theory of finite flat group schemes to understand the behavior of the $p$-adic Tate modules of Jacobians at the prime $p$. He studies modular forms of level one over finite rings (which need not lift to characteristic zero when the residue characteristic is $2$ or $3$). He proves theorems about mod-$p$ modular forms using what are essentially comparison theorems between etale cohomology and de Rham cohomology, and many more examples. The proof of the main theorem ($\\S5$, starting at page 156) is itself a very modern proof which fundamentally uses the viewpoint of $X_0(N)$ as a scheme.\n\nSecond, there are many beautiful ideas which have their original in this paper: it contains many of the first innovative ideas for studying $2$-dimensional (and beyond) Galois representations, including the link between geometric properties (multiplicity one) and arithmetic properties, geometric conceptions for studying congruences between Galois representations, understanding the importance of the finite-flat property of group schemes, and the identification of the Gorenstein property. There is a theoretical $p$-descent on the Eisenstein quotient when previously descents were almost all explicit $2$-descents with specific equations. It introduces the winding quotient, and so on.\n\nThird, while it is a dense paper, it is dense in the best possible way: many of the small diversions could have made interesting papers on their own. Indeed, even close readers of the paper today can find connections between Mazur's asides and cutting edge mathematics. When Mazur raises a question in the text, it is almost invariably very interesting. One particular (great) habit that Mazur has is thinking about various isomorphisms and by pinning down various canonical choices identifies refined invariants. To take a random example, consider his exploration of the Shimura subgroup at the end of section 11. He finishes with a question which to a casual reader may as well be a throw-away remark. But this question was first solved by Merel, and more recently generalized in some very nice work of Emmanuel Lecouturier. Lecouturier's ideas then played an important role in the work of Michael Harris and Akshay Venkatesh. Again, one could give many more such examples of this. Very few papers have the richness of footnotes and asides that this paper does. Never forget that one of the hardest things in mathematics is coming up with interesting questions and observations, and this paper contains many great ones - it is bursting with the ideas of a truly creative mathematician.\n\nFinally, the result itself is amazing, and (pretty much) remains the only method available for proving the main theorem (the second proof due to Mazur is very related to this one). To give a sense of how great the theorem is, note that if $E$ is a semistable elliptic curve, then either $E$ is isogenous to a curve with a $p$-torsion point, or $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible. This result (added for clarity: explicitly, Mazur's Theorem that $E/\\mathbf{Q}$ doesn't have a $p$-torsion point for $p > 7$) is crucially used in Wiles' proof of Fermat. One could certainly argue that without this paper (and how it transformed algebraic number theory) we would not have had Wiles' proof of Fermat, but it's even literally true that Mazur's theorem was (and remains so today, over 40 years later) an essential step in any proof of Fermat."

    "output": "Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication/trisomy versus deletion/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments. Some conditions, such as Williams syndrome, include positive aspects. Let go of the idea of the child you could have had, and focus on the real child you have right now. They need your love.\n"

    "input": " Why does C have the syntax ```int i, *pi, **ppi;``` for declaring an array of pointers to pointers to integers?",
    "output": "Dennis Ritchieâs paper on The Development of the C Language gives some idea of the reasoning behind this: namely, the fundamental rule in C that declaration syntax should match expression syntax\"\n\nFor each object of such a composed type, there was already a way to mention the underlying object: index the array, call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer. Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear. Thus,\n```int i, *pi, **ppi;\n```\ndeclare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a pointer to an integer. The syntax of these declarations reflects the observation that ```i```, ```*pi```, and ```**ppi``` all yield an ```int``` type when used in an expression. Similarly,\n```int f(), *f(), (*f)();\n```\ndeclare a function returning an integer, a function returning a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning an integer;\n```int *api[10], (*pai)[10];\n```\ndeclare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to an array of integers. In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.\n\n\nIt appears this rule trumped parser considerations. Its immediate consequence is that function declarations canât use specific keywords, or impose a different ordering of declaration components.\nItâs worth noting that parsing was somewhat different in early C, since function declarations didnât specify their arguments, and function definitions separated the argument list from the argument declarations (which werenât necessary for ```int``` arguments):\n```sum();\n```\ndeclares a ```sum``` function, which would then be defined as\n```sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n(no types needed here, the default is ```int```). So the parser didnât deal with types inside argument lists."

    "output": "The correct way to avoid SQL injection attacks, no matter which database you use, is to separate the data from SQL, so that data stays data and will never be interpreted as commands by the SQL parser. It is possible to create an SQL statement with correctly formatted data parts, but if you don't fully understand the details, you should always use prepared statements and parameterized queries. These are SQL statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters. This way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL.\n\nYou basically have two options to achieve this:\n\n1. Using PDO (for any supported database driver):\n```\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');\n$stmt->execute([ 'name' => $name ]);\n\nforeach ($stmt as $row) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\n2. Using MySQLi (for MySQL):\nSince PHP 8.2+ we can make use of execute_query() which prepares, binds parameters, and executes SQL statement in one method:\n```\n$result = $dbConnection->execute_query('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?', [$name]);\n\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\nUp to PHP8.1:\n```\n$stmt = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');\n$stmt->bind_param('s', $name); // 's' specifies the variable type => 'string'\n$stmt->execute();\n\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\nIf you're connecting to a database other than MySQL, there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to (for example, pg_prepare() and pg_execute() for PostgreSQL).

    "input": " I want to build a model water tower. I want to know how to build a model water tower with popsicle sticks.",
    "output": "Water towers are large, elevated tanks of water that are essential for the distribution of clean water to many communities across the globe. Not only do they come in many different shapes and sizes, but itâs intriguing to learn about the way water towers work. Whether you need a model water tower for a train set or school project, or you simply want to learn about the way they work, you can easily build your own model with the right materials and know-how.\n\n## Create a function model water tower\n\n1. Locate a small plastic bottle and a large plastic bottle. The small water bottle can be a standard-sized Coke, juice, or water bottle, as long as it has a screw-on cap. The large bottle should be a 2-liter soda bottle, jug, or a large juice bottle. Test the size of your bottles by placing the small bottle upside-down, with its neck sticking into the opening on the large bottle. The small bottle should sit comfortably on top of the large one. If it does not, you will need to find different bottles. The bottles must be plastic, as you will need to cut them.\n2. Remove the cap from the small bottle and cut a hole in the middle of it. Use scissors to punch a hole into the center of the cap, then widen the hole until itâs slightly smaller than the circumference of the holes at both ends of the tubing. Water will leak out of the hole if itâs too big, but it will still need to be big enough to push the tubing into it. Itâs better to have a hole thatâs too small than a hole thatâs too big, as you can always use your scissors to widen it if necessary.\n3. Punch a pin-sized hole in the bottom of the small water bottle. Use a pin, needle, earring, or any other device that will create an almost invisible hole. This will allow the bottle to vent when the water starts flowing.\n4. Cut a medium-sized hole in the side of the large bottle. Make the hole big enough that the cap and tubing can both fit through it. You can put the hole anywhere on the bottle that you choose, but roughly halfway down the bottle is a good option. Unlike the small bottle, you donât have to worry about leaks if this hole isnât the right size. This hole can be large or small just as long as the cap and tubing will fit through it comfortably.\n5. Feed 1 end of the tubing through the hole in the large bottle. Push the tubing through the large hole and out through the top of the large bottle. Lay the large bottle on its side with the hole you cut facing upward for easier access.\n6. Squeeze the same end of the tubing into the hole you cut in the cap. Feed roughly 1â2 inches (2.5â5.1 cm) of tubing in through the cap. Clamp the binder clip roughly 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end of the other side of the tubing. Put the side of the tubing with the binder clip into a bowl that will catch the water. If your hole on the cap is the right size, you will have to forcefully push the tubing into the hole. It should fit snugly in the hole without slipping.\n7. Fill the small bottle with water. Once the bottle is full, place the cap with the tubing through it on top of the bottle. Feed the tubing into the water, then screw the cap on tightly. Hold your finger over the pin-sized hole on the bottom of the bottle to keep water from leaking out.\n8. Place the small bottle upside-down in the top opening on the large bottle. The neck of the small bottle should fit all the way into the opening on the large bottle. You now have a functioning model water tower! The water should flow into the tubing once you flip it upside down, but the binder clip will stop the flow. Experiment by releasing the clip at different heights to see where the water stops flowing.\n\n\n## Build a model water tower with popsicle stick\n\n1. Cut the rounded ends off of roughly 70 Popsicle sticks. Barely snip both ends of each Popsicle stick to make the ends straight on both sides. Make them all as close to the same size as possible. To cut the sticks evenly, line up the second stick with the first stick you cut. Use the first Popsicle stick as reference for where to cut the second stick. Do the same thing for the third, the fourth, and so on, until all 70 Popsicle sticks are the same size.\n2. Snip 2 of the cut Popsicle sticks in half. You donât have to measure them, but cut them as close to the center as possible. You will now have 4 smaller pieces of Popsicle stick that are roughly half the length of the other Popsicle sticks.\n3. Apply glue to 1 end of 1 of the small stick sections. Connect the edge of a second small stick to the area where you just applied glue. Then, apply glue to the end of the second piece that is not connected. Glue the edge of a third small section to the open second section. Repeat this process for the fourth section, then apply glue to connect the edge of the fourth section to the open edge of the first section you glued. You will now have a square frame made out of the 4 smaller Popsicle pieces. Your frame doesnât have to be perfectly square. In fact, if youâre going for a rustic look, an imperfect square may even be ideal. If youâre using super glue, you can apply glue to all 4 edges before connecting them all together. If youâre using hot glue, make sure to glue each edge separately. This will keep the glue from drying before you can connect all 4 sections together.\n4. Line up 2 larger Popsicle sticks to create 1 long, straight stick. Place the sticks on a flat surface with their ends touching. Take another Popsicle stick of the same size and apply glue to the entire surface on 1 side, lengthwise. Place the glued side directly in the middle of the 2 sticks that are lined up. The third stick does not have to be exactly in the middle of the other 2 sticks, but it should be close enough that it holds the other 2 sticks together evenly.\n5. Repeat this process 3 more times. Follow the same process as before by lining up 2 of the larger Popsicle sticks and gluing a third stick on top of them. Do this 3 more times until you have 4 identical long sections that are each made out of 3 glued Popsicle sticks.\n6. Connect the end of 1 of the long sticks to the inside corner of the square frame. Apply glue to the inside edge of the long stick and place it at a slight outward angle, with the third stick that is holding the other 2 sticks together facing inward. Glue the long stick so that it does not poke out above the frame once connected. Do the same thing with the other 3 long sections you created in the other 3 corners of the frame. This will form the legs of the water tower, so make the angle as identical as possible for each of the long sticks. Keep the angle of the legs around 10-15 degrees. If the angle is too steep, the water tower will be too short. If it is too steep, it will probably topple over.\n7. Use another Popsicle stick to connect 2 of the legs together. Apply glue to each inside edge of the stick. Place the edges of the Popsicle stick on top of the lines where the 2 Popsicle sticks used to create the legs meet. Do the same thing with 3 other sticks until you have a stick connecting the legs on all 4 sides. You will need to spread the legs apart so that the sticks do not hang outside the edge of the leg. Keep the connecting sticks as level as possible. You want it to appear as if there is a single, continuous stick wrapping around the legs of the tower, not 4 separate small sticks.\n8. Lay 9 Popsicle sticks side-by-side on a flat surface. Line them up along their long edges so the sticks make a square when lined up. Apply a line of glue on the edge of the square down the length of all 9 Popsicle sticks. Place another Popsicle stick along the same direction as the glue line so that it holds all 9 sticks together. Do the same thing with another line of glue and another Popsicle stick on the other end of the square. The Popsicle sticks used to hold the other 9 sticks together should be the same length as the square, so that they match up perfectly with both corners and do not hang over the edge. You may need to trim the sticks down or remove one of the 9 sticks to match up the lengths. Use your hand to hold the Popsicle stick square together as you glue it. Place your hand flat on top of all 9 sticks, and do your best to keep them all together with no gaps between them.\n9. Apply glue to the top edge of the square frame you made earlier. Place the square platform you just created on top of the frame, connecting it to the base structure you already made. Glue the platform so that the Popsicle sticks used to connect the other sticks together are facing downward. You can also glue each individual Popsicle stick directly onto the square frame you made earlier. It will take longer, but you may be able to line the sticks up better this way.\n10. Cut the rim off of a small paper Dixie cup. Cut around the top of the open side to remove the outer rim. Try to keep the line as straight as possible, since this will form the foundation for the water container part of your water tower.\n11. Glue the remaining Popsicle sticks to the outside of the Dixie cup. Place glue along one of the wide edges of a Popsicle stick. Line up the top edge of the stick with the bottom edge of the cup and glue it down. Repeat this process around the entire circumference of the cup until it is completely covered. When gluing the sticks onto the cup, fan them out from one another to create a more realistic look. When you place the second stick on the cup, keep the edge of the stick as close to the edge of the cup as possible, but fan out the end that is jutting over the edge of the cup by about 5 degrees so that a small sliver of the cup can be seen underneath. Roughly half of the length of each Popsicle stick will be glued to the Dixie cup, while the other half will be jutting out over the rim of the cup.\n12. Cover the gaps in the Popsicle sticks by gluing another layer on top. If you fanned out the sticks to create a more realistic look, go back over the cup with additional Popsicle sticks. Glue the sticks directly in the middle of two sticks on the bottom layer so that the second layer covers up any slivers of cup that may be showing. Keep the edges lined up with the bottom edge of the cup as best you can.\n13. Place the Dixie cup in the middle of the platform with the open side up. Apply glue around the entire circumference of the bottom of the cup. Then, stick it down as close to the middle of the platform as possible. Use a lot of glue to attach the Dixie cup so that it doesnât fall off if itâs bumped. Optionally, you can wrap a string around the bottom and middle of the Dixie cup to give it a Western look. Wrap the string several times for better results.\n14. Use 2 wooden dowels to create a ladder. Place 2 wooden dowels roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on a flat surface. Line them up so they are parallel with the pointy side on top. Use small sections of Popsicle sticks roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) long to create the steps. Apply glue to both ends of 1 side of the stick, then place it horizontally between the dowels so that it connects them together. Do this all the way up the 2 dowels, roughly 7 times, until about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the pointy side of the dowels is left sticking out.\n15. Lean the ladder against the water tower at an angle and secure it with glue. Glue another small section of Popsicle stick horizontally across the very tips of the dowels, above and on the opposite side of the steps. Lean it up against the side of your water tower with the tips facing up. Place glue on the backside of the tips of the dowel and press down to attach it.\n"

    "input": " Can gases diffuse through metal?",
    "output": "Yes, some gases can diffuse into and through metal. It is the bane of the high-vacuum engineer's life. Hydrogen is the worst because it tends to dissociate into atoms at the surface and the nucleus, a single proton, can then leave its electron behind and wander through the metal lattice until it picks up another electron when it leaves.\n\nFor example Mu-metal, favoured for some applications, typically has to be annealed in hydrogen at high temperature. Once that is over, it can take weeks or months for the residual hydrogen to diffuse out of the metal before a high enough vacuum can be achieved and the work proceed.\n\nA &quot;virtual leak&quot; occurs where a small bubble of gas is embedded in the material inside a vacuum chamber. The leak usually happens because a tiny hole exists for the gas to diffuse out through, but sometimes the &quot;hole&quot; is no more than an ultra-thin skin of metal (invisible to the frustrated technician) and the gas diffuses through it. These little horrors can keep going for months or even years and generally mean replacing suspected parts and pumping down over and over again until the dodgy one is finally stumbled on.\n\nHelium is both monatomic and the physically smallest atom. It can diffuse more easily than any other neutral atom or molecule, making certain metal foils unsuitable as say gas-tight liners for airships. As noted in another answer, in quantity it can also affect the bulk properties of the metal.\n\nOn a more energetic scale, hydrogen and helium nuclei (protons and alpha particles) can pass through thin metal foils if fired with sufficient energy, and this has been used to establish the crystalline structures of some metals and alloys (where, for whatever reason, electrons were unsuitable).\n\nOther gases have much larger atoms (neon and other noble gases) or molecules (nitrogen and other diatomic molecules, water and other hydrides), but they can still diffuse extremely slowly through some metals. This can limit the lifetime of some microchips. A related phenomenon occurs where there is a defect in the lattice at the surface, such as a grain boundary, and a gas atom attaches to it. Defects are sometimes quite mobile and can migrate through the lattice; the gas atom will stabilise the defect and may be able to hitch a ride.\n\nQuantum processes such as tunnelling are not really relevant, as they work over distances smaller than the atomic wavelength, which in turn is typically far smaller than the thickness of any metal atom or foil. The probability of a gas atom tunnelling across is so infinitesimal as to be effectively zero."

    "input": " Is it true that there are more geniuses in China than in the USA?",
    "output": "This claim can actually be tested very easily. Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1/31,560 (SD=15) or 1/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1/161 would drop to about 1/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```. However, both these factors are not in any way close to the US/Chinese population ratio of about 1/4.375, so the original conclusion still holds."

To properly orient yourself, you need to find the original location of the samples, called the wells. With your sheet in front of you, look for the end of the sheet with a big pool of colored gel. The wells are the locations where the gel samples are loaded into the sheet and indicate the start of the sample.There should be one well for each of your samples. If one of the wells is lacking color, the sample may have been applied poorly. The wells indicate the negative end of the sheet. The opposite side of the sheet is the positive end. When each sample is applied to the sheet, the negatively-charged DNA travels across the sheet to the opposite side, leaving individual samples of DNA behind as it moves.\n3. Classify each strip by noting the origin of the samples. If youâve been given a key, understand that each horizontal row depicts a unique set of DNA. Use your key to determine what each row represents. The number of samples can be determined by counting the number of rows.

Identify the DNA ladder to establish a scale for the DNA. Depending on whether or not a DNA ladder was included in the test, you may have one strip designed to provide you with a scale to make comparisons easier. This scale is called the DNA ladder. The DNA ladder will contain strips of DNA of known sizes to make it easier to figure out how big or small the other strips are.Actual DNA samples will have a lot of variation in the sequence of the strips. There may be a few thin strips, followed by 1â2 inches (2.5â5.1 cm) of empty space, followed by thick strips, and ending in more thin strips.

A smaller and faster DNA sample leaves thinner strips behind as it moves. When looking at your results, determine which DNA samples are smaller and faster by looking for the thinnest strips.\n2. Find the thicker strips to find the slower DNA. Samples with larger molecules naturally move slower through the gel.

The size of the strips in a DNA ladder depend upon the type of ladder that was used for the test, but it will typically be either 10-100 bp (base pairs), or 500-1000 bp. The thickest strip is the highest size in a spectrum and the smallest size is the lowest. So for a 10-100 bp ladder, the thickest strip is 100 bp, and the thinnest strip is 10 bp.Tip: The range of a DNA ladder is printed on the bottle that the ladder came in. It may also be listed on the key if you were given one. There is no way to determine the range of a ladder based on the strip alone, since different gels will allow samples to travel at different speeds. 1000 bp is the same as 1 kb. Kb is short for kilobase, and the ladder may use this unit instead of bp. The smaller the scale is, the more accurate the comparisons will be. Base pairs and kilobases are simply units of measurement. They refer to the physical size of a DNA molecule.\n\n\n## Make conclusions\n\n1. Look for strips that appear at the same point on the sheet to find similarities. When looking at the sheet holistically, look for points where 2 or more strips appear in identical locations on different rows. This is an indicator that the DNA samples are somehow related. If there are 2 or more rows without any overlap in the sequence, they are entirely unrelated. The more related 2 samples are, the more overlap there will be in their sequences.In other words, if youâre looking at the sheet with the wells on the left, youâre looking for vertical columns where 2 strips appear at the same time. For example, a mother and her child will have half of their strips overlapping. A child and their second cousins though may only have 2-3 strips that overlap.\n2. Identify identical samples by finding strips with the same configuration. If 2 or more samples have a nearly identical sequence of strips, theyâre the same DNA. This doesnât necessarily mean that the source of the sample is the sameâidentical twins, for example, will have the same DNA sequence on an electrophoresis sheet. Identical strips are usually required to reasonably tie a suspect to a crime scene.Tip: Electrophoresis is often used by forensics teams to rule out suspects in criminal cases. It is also used to test maternity or paternity.\n3. Understand the limitations of electrophoresis testing. Electrophoresis testing is helpful when it comes to comparing DNA samples, but it can be hard to make definitive conclusions sometimes. The scale can only get so magnified, and smearing can make bands hard to interpret. In some instances, you wonât be able to conclusively say that 2 samples are related.More than 2 overlapping bands indicates a strong similarity between 2 samples. When assessing results, scientists will often say that there is a âhigh probabilityâ that 2 samples are related if less than half of the bands in 2 samples overlap.\n"

You, the tree outside and everything else made of carbon is right now undergoing continuous combustion. However, in the absence of catalyst, this process is too slow below a couple hundred degrees Celsius for it to be self-sustaining. More technically, combustion of organic matter is a highly exergonic process, but the activation energy is high. The meagre amount of heat generated by the handful of molecules reacting is too quickly diluted into the surroundings, and the reaction does not accelerate and spiral out of control (a fire, as described by the eternal Feynman).\n\nVery luckily for us, Life figured out this vast untapped source of chemical energy held back by kinetics approximately three billion years ago and developed a whole metabolic process to extract this energy in a stepwise fashion using catalysis, which we call aerobic respiration.

    "output": "The most important thing to remember here is that the two are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand. You can't have long-term economic growth without a healthy environment, because without a healthy environment, the economy will eventually collapse."

    "output": "Handedness is a very interesting phenomenon, but it is not as simple as being either left or right handed.\nIn most people the brain is asymmetrical, with some functions, such as language, being localised to one hemisphere. In most people this is the left hemisphere, which leads to these people being right handed as they use their dominant hand to perform tasks involving fine motor control, such as writing. Left handed people have their language centres in the right hemisphere, and while they may perform other tasks with their left hand they can often do tasks involving fine motor control with either hand.\nThere are also people who are truly ambidextrous, capable of performing tasks with either hand equally well. These people, while rare, do not have brains that are symmetrical, but have developed connections between the two hemispheres that allow them to access both motor cortices.\nThe genetics of handedness are complex and not well understood. There does appear to be a genetic component, but it is not straightforward. Identical twins who are brought up in the same environment are not always both left or right handed, suggesting that environmental factors also play a role.\nOne of the most interesting things about handedness is how early it becomes apparent. Children as young as two years old can be assessed for handedness, and it is very rare for a child's handedness to change over time. This suggests that it is very strongly influenced by genetics, with environmental factors playing a minor role."

    "output": "## Plan and prepare for the trip\n\n1. Plan to visit between June and August. Since snow and ice usually cover the cave temple, you wonât be able to access it during the cold winter and spring months. Wait until mid-June or July to plan your trip to the Amarnath Temple. Usually, the cave stays open through the first 1â2 weeks of August before it closes due to the terrain getting too difficult for travel. The actual dates when you can travel to the temple are chosen by the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) and it varies depending on the weather and how clear the trails are. You will not be able to reach the Amarnath Temple at any other time of the year.\n2. Get a Compulsory Health Certificate by a doctor approved by the SASB. Look at the list of approved doctors on the SASB website and schedule an appointment to see one. Bring the Compulsory Health Certificate from the site with you and fill out the self-assessment on top. Allow your doctor to run any tests to check if youâre fit for traveling to the Amarnath Temple. If they approve you for traveling, then youâll be able to make the journey.You can find the Compulsory Health Certificate for 2020 here: http://www.shriamarnathjishrine.com/Yatra2019/CHC%20form%20for%20Yatra%20-%202020.pdf. The certificate you need changes each year, so make sure youâre using the proper one. Since the Amarnath Temple is 4,000 metres (2.5 mi) above sea level, itâs possible to get altitude sickness if you arenât fit enough for the trip.Warning: You will not be allowed to go to Amarnath Temple if you are under 13, over 75, or more than 6 weeks pregnant.\n3. Submit a registration form online to the SASB. Select the date you want to travel to the temple on the calendar at the top of the page. Fill out the personal details on the registration form completely, including your name, birthday, phone number, and address. Then, list the clinic and doctor that completed your Compulsory Health Certificate. Upload a photograph of yourself and a scanned copy of the certificate before submitting the registration form.You can find the online registration form here: http://jksasb.nic.in/register.aspx. If you are accepted to travel to the temple, you will receive a text or email message about how to pay the 50 INR ($0.70 USD) fee. When you receive a permit, you must keep a copy on you at all times during your trip.\n4. Start taking 4â5 km (2.5â3.1 mi) walks 1 month prior to your trip. Start building up your endurance at least 1â2 months before your scheduled date of departure. Try to take the walks in the early morning or evening so you can get used to breathing in cool air. Continue taking walks each day up until you leave so you donât get exhausted while you hike to the temple.You can also practice deep breathing exercises and yoga so youâre able to improve your oxygen efficiency. This will help you breathe easier when youâre at a higher altitude since there isnât as much oxygen in the air.\n5. Pack warm clothes, waterproof shoes, a water bottle, and a walking stick. Only bring a lightweight, waterproof bag so you donât get exhausted while youâre trekking to the temple. Opt for wool clothes that are waterproof so you stay warm. Make sure you use waterproof trekking shoes and a walking stick so youâre easily able to traverse more difficult terrain. Since you'll be active, opt for a reusable water bottle as well.Other things you may need for your trip include an umbrella, flashlight, hat, gloves, and a raincoat. The weather can be unpredictable and temperatures may dip below 5 Â°C (41 Â°F) during the night. You donât have to bring tents or sleeping bags since there will be sites where you can spend the night.\n\n\n## Get to the temple\n\n1. Choose the Pahalgam route for an easier trek that lasts 3â5 days total. Select Pahalgam as your starting point if you want to follow the traditional pilgrimage route to the temple. While the trip does take longer to complete, it doesnât have any steep slopes that are difficult to climb, and you can ride or use ponies during most of the ascent. You will hike about 48 kilometres (30 mi) if you go from Pahalgam to the Amarnath Temple. You donât have to pay any additional fees to take the Pahalgam route.\n2. Pick the Baltal route for a steep climb that only takes 1â2 days round trip. If youâre an experienced climber or you feel like making the trip within a shorter amount of time, opt to start in Baltal, which is just north of the temple. Though the route from Baltal is much steeper than the path from Pahalgam, you can make the round-trip journey within a day.Plan to hike about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) using the Baltal route. If youâre too tired to descend back to Baltal, you can opt to stay at a camp at the top overnight before leaving the next day. There are no other fees to take the Baltal route.Warning: Ponies are not allowed on the Baltal route since itâs too steep, so you will have to walk the entire way.\n3. Fly into Srinagar to get the closest to either base camp. Look for flights that come into the Srinagar International Airport, since itâs only 2â3 hours from both Pahalgam and Baltalhead. Try to schedule your flight into the airport 1â2 days before the date youâre scheduled to go to Amarnath Temple so you have time to travel.You can also fly or take a train to Jammu, but youâll need to drive or take a bus further to to the base camps.\n4. Take a bus or taxi to the base camp you selected. Look for a bus or taxi service that runs from Srinagar to either Pahalgam or Baltal, depending on which route you plan on traveling. Typically, your ride will only last around 2â3 hours, but it may take longer depending on the road conditions.If you have a vehicle, you can also drive yourself to the base camps. Usually, there is some on-site parking, but it may be busy due to the number of travelers for the pilgrimage.\n5. Hire a helicopter tour if you donât want to hike all the way to the temple. Helicopters fly out from both Pahalgam and Baltal, so you can reserve them for either base camp. Choose the date that you want to travel to the temple and reserve your spot. Arrive at the helicopter port on your scheduled day and take it up toward the temple. The helicopter will be able to take you as close as 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) away, but you will need to hike the rest of the way.Typically, a helicopter tour will cost around 3,600 INR ($50 USD) for a round trip.\n\n\n## Trek to the cave\n\n1. Carry your belongings in a waterproof bag. Store your clothes and everything youâve brought with you in a waterproof bag or backpack so they donât get wet. Use a bag that fits tightly on your shoulders and back so it doesnât cause any strain while you climb up to the temple. Make sure you zip the bag at all times so water doesnât leak inside or get your things wet. Weather can be unpredictable during your ascent, so it may snow or rain while youâre climbing to the temple.\n2. Stop at tea stalls or small restaurant huts for meals and drinks. Look for small huts or stands along the route to the temple to see what kind of food and drinks they offer. Pay for the rations and enjoy them at one of the camps along the route. Otherwise, save non-perishable food in your bag so you can have it later during your trek.Some stalls may charge for food while others volunteer and provide meals for free.Tip: Always carry some back-up snacks, such as dried fruits or nuts, with you so you can eat as you get hungry.\n3. Protect your skin with sunscreen or petroleum jelly. Keep a bottle of sunscreen or petroleum jelly in your bag so you have access to it whenever you need it. Apply it to your exposed skin and rub it in until itâs clear so it can absorb fully. After 2 hours, put on another layer so you stay protected from the sun.Petroleum jelly can also help keep your skin from drying out due to the cold, dry air.\n4. Rest at the camps set up along the route. Look for tents and huts along the route where youâre able to rest for the night during your trip. Pay for tent rental and take time to relax so you donât feel too exhausted when you reach the shrine. Make sure your clothes arenât wet before you fall asleep so you donât get cold at night.If youâre shivering, slurring speech, experiencing blurry vision, or feeling nauseous, you may be experiencing altitude sickness. Rest as soon as possible and avoid climbing any higher.\n5. Pray to Shiva at the ice lingam when you reach the holy shrine. When you reach the Amarnath Temple, take off your shoes and enter the cave to see the ice lingam, which is a tall column of ice thatâs considered holy. Say a prayer to Shiva while youâre next to the lingam before exiting the shrine.\n"

    "input": " How do I play a concentration game?",
    "output": "## Play the concentration game\n\n1. Create game pieces. Make small cards using paper or something sturdier such as cardstock. Cut small squares out and be sure to make each piece the same size. Since this is a memory game, it is important that each card looks the same so you are unable to differentiate one card from the next.\n2. Write out information on game pieces. Work in pairs when writing out your review information on these cards. Write down a vocabulary word on the first card in the pair and its definition on the second. Continue writing on your cards until each review item has been covered. This game words best when reviewing things like definitions, spelling, examples, etc.\n3. Organize your cards. Flip over all your cards so that the writing is underneath. Place your cards face down and organize them into rows and columns until every game piece is situated.\n4. Flip over one card. Begin the game by choosing just one card to turn over. Read the definition or vocabulary word and choose one more card to turn over. If you flipped over the correct card, you should have a pair in which both cards are a match. When first starting out, this game is sheer luck, but after a few tries you will be able to remember where each card lies and can do your best to find its correct match.\n5. Set aside pairs. When you have found two cards that are a match, set that pair aside so that your game board becomes smaller. Continue playing until every card has been turned over and you have created matches for each game piece. When you are finished playing, you can simply shuffle your cards and redistribute them to create your game board and play again.\n\n\n## Play with card\n\n1. Obtain a deck of cards. The first thing you need to do is get an entire deck of cards. Be sure you arenât missing any because it will affect how you play the game.\n2. Create a list of review items. Using your study materials, create a list of items you want to review. This list must be numbered and can be anything from definitions to vocabulary.\n3. Pull out face cards from your deck. You want to eliminate any face cards from your deck because the only cards needed are those with numbers. You may set the face cards aside until you have finished playing. An alternative to pulling out face cards is using them to play the game. Treat these cards like wild cards and whenever you draw one you can choose to review any item from your list that you wish to review.\n4. Shuffle your cards. It is very important to shuffle your deck. By doing this, you will ensure that each review item gets chosen by mixing up the numbers within the deck.\n5. Draw cards. Place your cards in a pile after shuffling them and draw the first card off the top. You may set aside all the cards you have already drawn.\n6. Review information corresponding to the number on each card. Look at the number on the card you drew and find the corresponding number on your list of review items. Review the information for that particular number. Continue to draw cards and review the information corresponding to those cards until you have gone through the entire deck.\n\n\n## Play a guess game\n\n1. Create a list of questions. Before generating a list of game questions, you must first go through all of your study materials and review critical information. While reviewing, form questions and produce a list.\n2. Cut small pieces of paper. Once your list is created you are ready to craft several pieces of small paper. These pieces of paper will serve as the main game pieces. Use card stock or heavy-duty paper for sturdy game pieces. Use sticky notes as another option to quickly create piece.\n3. Number papers. You created your main game pieces so now you must number them according to how many questions you developed.\n4. Put papers in container. Place all of your numbered game pieces into the container and be careful not to forget any. Be sure to shake the container once youâve put all your game pieces inside to ensure the pieces are mixed sufficiently.\n5. Draw paper from container. Keep your list of questions next to you as you pull pieces out of the container. Choose randomly from the container and read the number on the piece of paper.\n6. Answer corresponding questions. Find the number on your question list that corresponds to the number on your game piece and read that question.\n7. Set aside used pieces. After answering each question, put the used game pieces aside so as not to repeat any. If you are unable to recall the correct answers to any questions you can make two piles designating one for challenging questions and one for easy questions. When you play the game for again, you can just put the challenging questions inside the container and spend less time reviewing the questions you already know.\n8. Repeat steps until container is empty. Continue draw the papers from the container until youâve used them all. To play again, simply fill up the container and start over.\n"

Since the users' eyes never leave the left portion of the window, we place the button on the bottom left. This is especially important for forms that use the field name above the field, with most fields lying flush left on the form (as opposed to fields to the right of their names).\nSmall Dialogue & Modal Windows are fixed width and tend to be small. Most contain simple phrases or questions, read right to left: having a button on the bottom right feels like both the most progressive position and the final resting place for the eye. Were the modal window large enough to contain a long form, we would probably follow the first principal for forms.\nIn the end, the heuristic is this:\n\n* Large Windows & Forms get the button on the bottom left.\n* Small Windows & Dialogues get the button on the bottom right.\n\nNote the buttons on stackexchange sites:\n\n* Post Your Answer button at the bottom-left of the longer form\n\n* Add Comment button to the right of a small field\n\nFurthermore, with mobile-first responsive being the new law of the land, the button placement varies even more based on context and user expectation.

I can also make friends with people from different backgrounds.\n\n*  Exercise and improve my physical condition. With more extra time, I would become more active and commit to a healtier lifestyle. For example, I'll stick to a regular fitness plan and increase my physical activity by adding strength training and taking a Yogo class. \n\n*  Work more to advance my career and personal growth. I might use the extra time to learn new skills outside of my primary career. For example, I would learn a new language or pursue a part-time job in art history or education. Moreover, I would get out of my comfort zone and become more proactive in buidling my network. \n\n*  Get more involved in my community.

    "input": " What happens if you make an illegal move in a chess game?",
    "output": "This only really applies to over the board games (since online chess servers prevent illegal moves).\nIn a standard time control game, under USCF rules, when the illegal move is noticed by one of the players, a few things happen.  First, the illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.  If not, then the current position stands, and play continues.  Assuming that the move is recent, the position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.\nThen, the player that made the illegal move now must make a legal move with the same piece (if one exists).  If there are no legal moves, then the player is free to make any move.  This is due to the touch move rule.  Finally, if the offending player has pressed the clock, a two minute &quot;bonus&quot; is added to the opponent's clock to compensate them for any time lost and to penalize the offending player.\nHere is the relevant passage from the USCF rulebook:\n\n11A. Illegal move during last ten moves. If, during a game, it is found that one of either player's last ten moves was illegal, the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move counters on clocks that have them may by readjusted.\n11D. Illegal move. If, a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the opponent's clock).\n\nIn blitz chess, the rules are different.  According to the WBCA (World Blitz Chess Association) rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.  This rule is frequently enforced in casual games too.  The most common way that this occurs is that one player doesn't notice that they are in check and makes a move that doesn't get out of check.  Then the checking player simply captures the king and claims a victory.\nBecause blitz is a much faster pace game, the illegal move must be noticed within two moves.  If it is not, then the current position stands and play continues.\nAt no point is the game cancelled due to an illegal move.  Pretty much once a game starts and both players make a move, a result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded."

    "output": "This is definitely allowed, and a good tactic to leverage a cash advantage.\nThere is no minimum or maximum price for an auction.  The rules state:\n\nBidding may start at any price.\n\nMonopoly auctions do not have &quot;the bidding will start at $10&quot;.  They just have &quot;bidding is open&quot;.  Once the auction begins, a bid by any player sets the minimum price for the auction at that bid.  Your opponent could easily bid $10 on the property, forcing you to either let them have it for $10 or bid more than you have in cash.  You could bid first, say starting the bid at $5, but that doesn't meaningfully change the situation, as they can just respond by out-bidding you at $10.\n\nYou may bid more money than you have in cash, but you are still obligated to pay it if you win the auction.  This may be a reasonable play if you can afford it by mortgaging property and/or selling houses, especially to drive up the price for your opponent.  But be careful not to bid  more than you can pay after mortgages and sales, as if you win the auction and can't pay your bid, you go bankrupt.  In particular, if you bid more than you can afford, you opponents can all just let you win the bid, at which point you go bankrupt and the property you just bought would go up for auction again (in addition to all your other properties)."

    "output": "Fuzzy String Matching is the process of performing a human-like estimation of the similarity of two words or phrases. In many cases, it involves implementing the Levenshtein distance algorithm, which determines how many changes must be made to a string or phrase to turn it into another string or phrase. The following implementation in VBA involves a weighted comparison of the length of the two phrases, the number of changes between each phrase, and whether each word could be found in the target entry.\n\n```\n'Calculate the Levenshtein Distance between two strings (the number of insertions,\n'deletions, and substitutions needed to transform the first string into the second)\nPublic Function LevenshteinDistance(ByRef S1 As String, ByVal S2 As String) As Long\n    Dim L1 As Long, L2 As Long, D() As Long 'Length of input strings and distance matrix\n    Dim i As Long, j As Long, cost As Long 'loop counters and cost of substitution for current letter\n    Dim cI As Long, cD As Long, cS As Long 'cost of next Insertion, Deletion and Substitution\n    L1 = Len(S1): L2 = Len(S2)\n    ReDim D(0 To L1, 0 To L2)\n    For i = 0 To L1: D(i, 0) = i: Next i\n    For j = 0 To L2: D(0, j) = j: Next j\n\n    For j = 1 To L2\n        For i = 1 To L1\n            cost = Abs(StrComp(Mid$(S1, i, 1), Mid$(S2, j, 1), vbTextCompare))\n            cI = D(i - 1, j) + 1\n            cD = D(i, j - 1) + 1\n            cS = D(i - 1, j - 1) + cost\n            If cI <= cD Then 'Insertion or Substitution\n                If cI <= cS Then D(i, j) = cI Else D(i, j) = cS\n            Else 'Deletion or Substitution\n                If cD <= cS Then D(i, j) = cD Else D(i, j) = cS\n            End If\n        Next i\n    Next j\n    LevenshteinDistance = D(L1, L2)\nEnd Function\n```\n\nWe can creat two separate metrics for evaluating the similarity of two strings. One is \"valuePhrase\" and the other is \"valueWords\". valuePhrase is just the Levenshtein distance between the two phrases, and valueWords splits the string into individual words, based on delimiters such as spaces, dashes, and anything else you'd like, and compares each word to each other word, summing up the shortest Levenshtein distance connecting any two words. Essentially, it measures whether the information in one 'phrase' is really contained in another, just as a word-wise permutation.\n\nvalueWords, valuePhrase, and Split function:\n```\nPublic Function valuePhrase#(ByRef S1$, ByRef S2$)\n    valuePhrase = LevenshteinDistance(S1, S2)\nEnd Function\n\nPublic Function valueWords#(ByRef S1$, ByRef S2$)\n    Dim wordsS1$(), wordsS2$()\n    wordsS1 = SplitMultiDelims(S1, \" _-\")\n    wordsS2 = SplitMultiDelims(S2, \" _-\")\n    Dim word1%, word2%, thisD#, wordbest#\n    Dim wordsTotal#\n    For word1 = LBound(wordsS1) To UBound(wordsS1)\n        wordbest = Len(S2)\n        For word2 = LBound(wordsS2) To UBound(wordsS2)\n            thisD = LevenshteinDistance(wordsS1(word1), wordsS2(word2))\n            If thisD < wordbest Then wordbest = thisD\n            If thisD = 0 Then GoTo foundbest\n        Next word2\nfoundbest:\n        wordsTotal = wordsTotal + wordbest\n    Next word1\n    valueWords = wordsTotal\nEnd Function\n\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n' SplitMultiDelims\n' This function splits Text into an array of substrings, each substring\n' delimited by any character in DelimChars.

Fuzzy string matching is, itself, a fuzzy science, and so by creating linearly independent metrics for measuring string similarity, and having a known set of strings we wish to match to each other, we can find the parameters that, for our specific styles of strings, give the best fuzzy match results.\n\nTo allow the optimization of fuzzy matching, we can weight each metric. The formula that defines the final score is a simply combination of the metrics and their weights: \n```\nvalue = Min(phraseWeight*phraseValue, wordsWeight*wordsValue)*minWeight\n      + Max(phraseWeight*phraseValue, wordsWeight*wordsValue)*maxWeight\n      + lengthWeight*lengthValue\n```\n\nFor your specific context, you have to come up with a set of weights for any metrics you come up with to determine similarity. With the appropriate set of heuristics and weights, you'll have your comparison program quickly making the decisions that you would have made."

    "output": "* Yes, by default Android will scale your image down to fit the ImageView, maintaining the aspect ratio. However, make sure you're setting the image to the ImageView using ```android:src=&quot;...&quot;``` rather than ```android:background=&quot;...&quot;```. ```src=``` makes it scale the image maintaining aspect ratio, but ```background=``` makes it scale and distort the image to make it fit exactly to the size of the ImageView. (You can use a background and a source at the same time though, which can be useful for things like displaying a frame around the main image, using just one ImageView.)\n\n* You should also see ```android:adjustViewBounds``` to make the ImageView resize itself to fit the rescaled image. For example, if you have a rectangular image in what would normally be a square ImageView, adjustViewBounds=true will make it resize the ImageView to be rectangular as well. This then affects how other Views are laid out around the ImageView.\n\nThen as Samuh wrote, you can change the way it default scales images using the ```android:scaleType``` parameter. \n\nBy the way, the easiest way to discover how this works would simply have been to experiment a bit yourself! Just remember to look at the layouts in the emulator itself (or an actual phone) as the preview in Eclipse is usually wrong.\n\n"

    "output": "First off, I highly recommend the book Get a Financial Life. The basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward, and this book does a great job with it. It is very light reading, and it really geared for the young person starting their career. \n\nNow, with that out of the way, there's really two kinds of \"investing\" to think about:\n\n1. Retirement (401k, IRA, SIMPLE, etc)\n2. Non-Retirement (Brokerage account, investing in individual stocks, day trading, etc)\n\nFor most individuals, it is best to take care of #1 first. Most people shouldn't even think about #2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts, established an emergency fund, and gotten their debt under control.\n\nThere are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing, both from your employer, and the government. All the more reason to take care of #1 before #2!\n\nYour employer probably offers some kind of 401k (or equivalent, like a 403b) with a company-provided match. This is a potential 100% return on your investment after the vesting period. No investment you make on your own will ever match that. Additionally, there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k. (The money you contribute doesn't count as taxable income.)\n\n***The best way to start investing is to learn about your employer's retirement plan, and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching.***\n\nBeyond this, there are also Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you can open to contribute money to on your own. You should open one of these and start contributing, but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k. The IRA won't give you that 100% ROI that the 401k will.\n\nKeep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much \"walled off\" from your day-to-day financial life. Money that goes into a retirement account generally can't be touched until retirement age, unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties. You generally don't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account.\n\nOne other thing to note: Your 401K and your IRA is an account that you put money into. Just because the money is sitting in the account doesn't necessarily mean it is invested. You put the money into this account, and then you use this money for investments. How you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself. Here is a good starting point."

    "input": " What is the point of the guideline that says that the hash code of an object must not change during the lifetime of the object?",
    "output": "The answer is mostly, it is a valid guideline, but perhaps not a valid rule. It also doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nThe point being made is that for mutable types, you cannot base the hash code on the mutable data because two equal objects must return the same hash code and the hash code has to be valid for the lifetime of the object. If the hash code changes, you end up with an object that gets lost in a hashed collection because it no longer lives in the correct hash bin.\nFor example, object A returns hash of 1. So, it goes in bin 1 of the hash table. Then you change object A such that it returns a hash of 2. When a hash table goes looking for it, it looks in bin 2 and can't find it - the object is orphaned in bin 1.  This is why the hash code must not change for the lifetime of the object, and just one reason why writing GetHashCode implementations is a pain in the butt.\n\nA guideline is just a guide, not a rule. In reality, ```GetHashCode``` only has to follow these guidelines when things expect the object to follow the guidelines, such as when it is being stored in a hash table. If you never intend to use your objects in hash tables (or anything else that relies on the rules of ```GetHashCode```), your implementation doesn't need to follow the guidelines. When you see \"for the lifetime of the object\", you should read \"for the time the object needs to co-operate with hash tables\" or similar. Like most things, ```GetHashCode``` is about knowing when to break the rules."

    "input": " How do I wear a cowboy hat?",
    "output": "Cowboy hats have a long tradition, both for functional purposes while working and as a fashion statement. Even if it seems as simple as setting the hat on your head and going about your business, there are some rules to follow if you want to wear a cowboy hat properly. You need to get a hat that fits right, shape it a little bit, make sure the front is forward, and angle to give your look the proper attitude.\n\n## Choose your hat\n\n1. Get the right size. The first step to properly wearing a cowboy hat is making sure the hat is the right size and fits your head properly. Cowboy hats should typically fit snug around your head. If you are buying one, know your hat size ahead of time but also try the hat on before you buy it.\n2. Fix your current hat to fit better. You may have a hat already that is just barely too big but not big enough that you would want to get a smaller size. You can fix this. You can buy foam strip that is specifically made to put into hats to make them fit tighter. Depending on how much you need, and the shape of your head, you can either put this foam all the way around, or you can put a little in the front and back, just on the sides, or even just the front or just the back. Figure out where your hat is fitting too loosely. If the whole hat is sitting too low on your head, you probably want to put some sizing foam around the whole hat. There should be a band around the inside of the hat that you can flip up and place the foam strip under. Then flip the band back down before wearing the hat.\n3. Pick the right hat. You have a lot of options when it comes to cowboy hats. The main material choices are felt (made of beaver or rabbit pelt), leather, and straw. Felt hats are warmer so they tend to be worn more in the cold seasons. Straw hats are better for staying cool during hot days.\n4. Shape your hat. Most cowboy hats can be conformed to a certain shape by gently bending and squeezing them. How exactly you do this will depend on the material of the hat itself. You want the front and back of the brim to be fairly flat. Curl the sides so they stick up just slightly. You donât want to curl them too tightly. You can also gently dent the sides of the crown of the hat. No tools are required for this. Simply use your hands.\n\n\n## Put the hat on your head\n\n1. Adjust your hair. You need to make sure that your hair does not get in the way of your hat sitting properly on your head. If you have short hair, this wonât apply to you. For longer hair, it can be a good idea to slick your hair back so it lays smoothly. Donât pile your hair up on your head in any way. If you need to tie it in place, a ponytail that hangs straight down is the best option.\n2. Put the bow to the back. One of the most basic rules is making sure that the hat is on your head correctly with the front to the front. Most cowboy hats have a small bow on the inside lining around the headband. The bow should be in the back of your head. If your hat does not have this bow, a general rule is that the hat will be narrower at the front.\n3. Angle your brim accordingly. Positioning your hat in different ways can affect the way you look in the way. If you want to appear casual and friendly, tilt the front of the hat up just slightly so you can see about half of you forehead. To look more serious, or almost mysterious, lower the brim to just above your eyebrows. Slanting the hat slightly to the left or right will give you an appearance of being confident, almost to the point of looking for women or for trouble.\n4. Pick the right outfit. Your best and simplest bet to wear with a cowboy hat is a button up shirt, jeans, and a nice pair of cowboy boots. The shirt be a plain color or plaid. Flannel shirt work well too. You want basic, straight leg blue jeans with no extra pockets on the sides, no designs or extra buttons on the back pockets, no intentional bleaching or stain marks. Just classic blue jeans. If you are going to wear a cowboy hat, boots are pretty much a must. Itâs going to look wrong if you try to go out with some sneakers on. You should also tuck in your shirt and most likely wear a nice black or brown leather belt. Fancy belt buckle is optional.\n"

    "input": " A police officer in the United States was fired for making racist comments on social media. Is this a violation of the First Amendment?",
    "output": "In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech. The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" Thatâs not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time.\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations."

    "output": "Here is the abstract and introduction of a research proposal about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models:\n\n\n#Controlling Biases in Large Language Models\n\n\n##Abstract\n\nWhile large language models are unlocking previously unimaginable applications, their extensive usage also exacerbates the risk of generating toxic text that amplifies adverse biases in the training data. We propose utilizing the newfound instruction understanding abilities of large language models to identify, explain, and mitigate undesirable biases in text. Our research plan begins with a novel method for eliciting natural language explanations of why a particular text is harmful, without any training data or definition of what constitutes toxic text. We then propose to investigate whether explicitly instructing models to avoid biases using natural language prompts can steer them away from unwanted outputs. Finally, we aim to explore a more permanent solution by fine-tuning the model on anti-harm instructions (behavioral guidelines, codes of conduct, diversity training), and thus informing it on which utterances should be avoided. Successfully tuning large language models to better align with acceptable behavior will dramatically advance the ability to deploy safer, fairer models in real-world settings.\n\n\n##Introduction\n\nLanguage models, the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP), are known to reflect and even amplify biases in training corpora, often resulting in racist, sexist, and generally toxic outputs. Susceptibility to such harmful biases hinders the deployment of these models and limits their applicability.\n\nA common approach for developing safer models is to try to control the training corpora. [Citations], for example, used a list of banned words to filter potentially harmful text from the C4 corpus. This simple approach fails to remove all adverse biases from the text, as toxic content can be written using words that are, by themselves, benign. Another technique for corpus intervention is data augmentation [Citations], which adds a counterfactual example for each utterance of a potentially biased text. This technique, however, only applies when counterfactual swaps are possible, e.g. gender, and it requires prior knowledge of all potential biases in the training corpus. Data augmentation enlarges an already oversized corpus, and can often create artificial and even unrealistic texts if not done carefully. Finally, various approaches perform post-training debiasing [Citations], but these often result in significant performance degradation on downstream tasks.\n\nWe propose explaining and mitigating adverse biases via natural language instructions. Our plan includes three parts:\n*  Inducing natural language explanations of adverse biases in a given text. We intend to build on our recent work on instruction induction [Citations], and prompt language models to describe âin their own wordsâ whether a given text is problematic and why.\n*  Controlling the manifestation of model biases during generation by prompting language models with explicit instructions. We plan to investigate the use of both model-generated explanations and existing guidelines written for humans (e.g. code of conduct) to reduce and control adverse biases during inference.\n*  Mitigating adverse biases in the model itself by fine-tuning on behavioral guidelines. The goal is to efficiently adapt the model itself so that it (permanently) generates less harmful content. We build on recent work which shows that fine-tuning on task instructions (instruction tuning) improves the zero-shot learning abilities of language models [Citations]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has utilized this framework for teaching models what behaviors should be avoided. The success of instruction tuning suggests that our approach is viable, and we hope it can accelerate the progress towards safer, fairer models."

    "output": "If you would prefer to avoid intermediate image files, the commands provided by LordNeckBeard can be piped between ```ffmpeg``` and ImageMagick's ```convert``` so that no intermediate files are required:\n```ffmpeg -i input.flv -vf scale=320:-1 -r 10 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm - | convert -delay 10 -loop 0 - output.gif\n```\nThe ```-f image2pipe``` tells ffmpeg to split the video into images and make it suitable to be piped out, and ```-vcodec ppm``` specifies the output format to be ppm (for some reason if the format is png, either ```convert``` does not read all the images from the pipe, or ffmpeg does not output them all). The ```-``` for both commands specifies that a pipe will be used for output and input respectively.\nTo optimize the result without saving a file, you can pipe the output from ```convert``` to a second ```convert``` command:\n```ffmpeg -i input.flv -vf scale=320:-1 -r 10 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm - | convert -delay 10 -loop 0 - gif:- | convert -layers Optimize - output.gif\n```\nThe ```gif:-``` tells ```convert``` to pipe its output as gif formatted data and ```-layers Optimize``` tells the second ```convert``` to perform ```optimize-frame``` and ```optimize-transparancy``` methods (see the ImageMagick Introduction to Animation Optimization). Note that the output from the ```-layers Optimize``` may not always provide a smaller file size, so you may want to try converting to a gif without optimization first to be sure.\nRemember that during this whole process everything is in memory so you may need sufficient memory if the images are quite large."

    "output": "AlÃ©m do custo ser mais alto como mencionado, deve-se levar em conta vÃ¡rios fatores:\n\n* Volume de dados: para um baixo volume de dados pode nÃ£o haver problema. Por outro lado, para armazenamento de grande massa de dados o banco de dados Ã© praticamente inviÃ¡vel. Pergunte ao Facebook ou ao Google se eles usariam banco. O Facebook, por exemplo, usa um sistema de arquivos personalizado para tornar o acesso mais rÃ¡pido ainda e diminuir a o overhead por arquivo exigido pelos sistemas de arquivos tradicionais.\n* ClusterizaÃ§Ã£o: uma vantagem do banco de dados Ã© no caso do seu sistema rodar em vÃ¡rios servidores, todos terÃ£o acesso uniforme aos arquivos. PorÃ©m, usar uma unidade na rede para armazenar os arquivos.\n* Disponibilidade: seu sistema vai ter muitos acessos? Isso pode sobrecarregar um banco de dados tradicional. Por outro lado, seu servidor HTTP pode usar as rotinas de acesso de baixo nÃ­vel ao sistema de arquivos para enviar o stream de dados ao cliente.\n* Escalabilidade: se a demanda de volume ou disponibilidade aumentarem, serÃ¡ possÃ­vel adicionar mais capacidade ao sistema? Ã muito mais fÃ¡cil dividir arquivos entre servidores diferentes do que distribuir registros de uma tabela em mais servidores.\n* Flexibilidade: fazer cÃ³pias de seguranÃ§a, mover arquivos de um servidor para outro, fazer algum processamento nos arquivos armazenados, tudo isso fica mais fÃ¡cil se os arquivos estiverem num diretÃ³rio. Se vocÃª faz o deploy em ambiente de cliente, os arquivos no disco nÃ£o inviabilizam vocÃª de receber cÃ³pias do banco de dados para testes. Tente pedir para o seu cliente enviar terabytes de dados para vocÃª analisar se der algum problema no banco.\n* Overhead de leitura e gravaÃ§Ã£o: o custo computacional para gravar e ler dados do banco de dados Ã© maior do que para ler e gravar diretamente em um arquivo.\n\nExistem vÃ¡rias estratÃ©gias para escalar um sistema tanto em termos de disponibilidade quanto em volume. Basicamente essas estratÃ©gias consistem em distribui-los em vÃ¡rios vÃ¡rios servidores e redirecionar o usuÃ¡rio para cada um deles conforme algum critÃ©rio. Os detalhes variam de implementaÃ§Ã£o, tais como: estratÃ©gia de atualizaÃ§Ã£o dos dados, redundÃ¢ncia, critÃ©rios de distribuiÃ§Ã£o, etc.\nUma das grandes dificuldades em gerenciar arquivos fora do BD Ã© que temos agora duas fontes de dados distintas e que precisam estar sempre em sincronia.\nDo ponto de vista de seguranÃ§a, efetivamente hÃ¡ pouca diferenÃ§a.

    "input": " How does std::function work?",
    "output": "The implementation of ```std::function``` can differ from one implementation to another, but the core idea is that it uses type-erasure. While there are multiple ways of doing it, you can imagine a trivial (not optimal) solution could be like this (simplified for the specific case of ```std::function<int (double)>``` for the sake of simplicity):\n```struct callable_base {\n   virtual int operator()(double d) = 0;\n   virtual ~callable_base() {}\n};\ntemplate <typename F>\nstruct callable : callable_base {\n   F functor;\n   callable(F functor) : functor(functor) {}\n   virtual int operator()(double d) { return functor(d); }\n};\nclass function_int_double {\n   std::unique_ptr<callable_base> c;\npublic:\n   template <typename F>\n   function(F f) {\n      c.reset(new callable<F>(f));\n   }\n   int operator()(double d) { return c(d); }\n// ...\n};\n```\nIn this simple approach the ```function``` object would store just a ```unique_ptr``` to a base type. For each different functor used with the ```function```, a new type derived from the base is created and an object of that type instantiated dynamically. The ```std::function``` object is always of the same size and will allocate space as needed for the different functors in the heap.\nIn real life there are different optimizations that provide performance advantages but would complicate the answer. The type could use small object optimizations, the dynamic dispatch can be replaced by a free-function pointer that takes the functor as argument to avoid one level of indirection, but the idea is basically the same.\n\nRegarding the issue of how copies of the ```std::function``` behave, a quick test indicates that copies of the internal callable object are done, rather than sharing the state.\n```// g++4.8\nint main() {\n   int value = 5;\n   typedef std::function<void()> fun;\n   fun f1 = [=]() mutable { std::cout << value++ << '\\n' };\n   fun f2 = f1;\n   f1();                    // prints 5\n   fun f3 = f1;\n   f2();                    // prints 5\n   f3();                    // prints 6 (copy after first increment)\n}\n```\nThe test indicates that ```f2``` gets a copy of the callable entity, rather than a reference. If the callable entity was shared by the different ```std::function<>``` objects, the output of the program would have been 5, 6, 7."

I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n"

    "input": " I am a beginner at slacklining. I would like to know the basics of how to slackline. I would also like to know a sample skill progression for beginners.",
    "output": "## The basics\n\n1. Start with a short slackline. The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:\n\t* The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;\n\t* The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;\n\t* It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.\n2. Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline. Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly. Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.\n3. You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling. The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls. Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.\n4. Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself. If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.\n5. Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor. This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.\n6. Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.\n7. Center your weight directly over the foot on the line. With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.\n8. Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.\n9. Bend the leg that is on the slackline. Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.\n10. Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance. Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance. Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.\n11. Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.\n12. Practice with the other foot. Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.\n13. Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!\n\n\n## Sample skill progression for beginners\n\n1. These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks. Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line. Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line. Balance on one foot by yourself. Balance on the other foot. Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line. Take small steps forward. Take small steps backwards. Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time. Turn on the line.\n2. Additionally, learn how to fall safely. As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet. As you try new tricks, the slackline can \"throw\" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the \"throw\" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet. If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.\n3. You can also try starting with \"training wheels.\" One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble. When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, youâll soon find that you donât need training wheels any more!\n"

A \"fast\" ping time on the Internet is 10&nbsp;ms, which is 10,000,000&nbsp;ns. Adding even a few hundred feet of cable isn't going to have a noticeable effect at that point. In fact, nearly every step of the way involves delays which are more extreme than those seen from signal propagation. For example, most consumer grade routers will wait for the last byte of an incoming packet to be received and check it for errors before sending the first byte of the packet on its way. This delay will be on the order of 5,000&nbsp;ns! Given that the maximum length of cable you can run (per the Ethernet spec) is 300&nbsp;ft, the cable length could never cause more than 300&nbsp;ns of delay due to the cable!"

    "input": " I am a helpful AI assistant. Please help me solve the Shakespeare puzzle in Silent Hill 3.",
    "output": "Silent Hill 3 is the third installment in the Silent Hill video game series. It is considered to be a survival horror video game in which your character must solve different puzzles and psychological challenges in order to advance. The Shakespeare puzzle can be found during the Shopping Center stage. Itâs inside a bookstore called My Bestsellers.\n\n## Solve the puzzle on easy mode\n\n1. Pick up the Shakespeare books that have fallen on the ground. In this difficulty, there will only be 2 books on the ground: Anthology 1 and Anthology 3.\n2. Examine the bookshelf. Youâll be allowed to place the books you found on the floor in the empty slots.\n3. Click on Anthology 1 and place it on the first slot of the bookshelf.\n4. Click on Anthology 3 and place it on the third slot on the bookshelf. A code will appear after placing the two books correctly.\n5. Use the code on the door at the back side of the bookstore. In this puzzle, you only need to arrange the books in the proper order: (from left to right) Anthology 1, Anthology 2, Anthology 3, Anthology 4, and then Anthology 5.\n\n\n## Solve the puzzle on normal mode\n\n1. Read the note on the door. It will read âFair is foul, and foul is fair. Put these books out of order.â\n2. Pick up all the books on the floor. There will be 5 books in normal mode.\n3. Examine the bookshelf. Youâll be allowed to place the books on the empty space on the shelf. Put the books in randomly; order doesnât matter as this puzzle is generated randomly.\n4. Take a good look at the books. Youâll see there are black markings on it; this is the code you need.\n5. Arrange the books until you get the correct order. It wonât be too hard as the numbers are written quite obviously. Try to make out the numbers written on the spine of the books and keep moving them until you get it right.\n\n\n## Solve the puzzle on hard mode\n\n1. Know the title of each anthology book. In order to find the title of the book, youâll need to open your inventory and choose to examine the book. Anthology 1 is Romeo and Juliet\n\t* Anthology 2 is King Lear\n\t* Anthology 3 is Macbeth\n\t* Anthology 4 is Hamlet\n\t* Anthology 5 is Othello\n2. Decipher the first stanza of the clue. This stanza mentions âThe first words at thy left hand.â\n\t* This is an instruction for solving the puzzle; meaning youâll need to arrange the books from left to right.\n3. Place Anthology 4 on the first spot on the left side of the bookshelf. The first stanza mentions âfalse lunacyâ and âincomprehensible words,â which is a reference to the plot of Hamlet.\n4. Place Anthology 1 on the second spot of the bookshelf. The second stanza is the easiest to decipher âplaying at deathâ and ânameless loverâ refers to the last part of Romeo and Juliet.\n5. Place Anthology 5 on the third spot on the bookshelf. This stanza is a reference to Othello, referring to the innocence of Desdemona and the lies of Iago.\n6. Place Anthology 2 on the fourth spot on the bookshelf. This stanza refers to the story of King Lear, where his daughter Cordelia refuses to speak about how much she loves her father as opposed to the false flattery of her sisters.\n7. Place Anthology 3 on the last spot on the bookshelf. And with all 5 books on the bookshelf you would have the correct code.\n8. Decipher the last clue. 41523 is not the pass code; on the sixth stanza, you will be instructed to more. â41523âOne vengeful man spilled blood for twoâ (Hamlet). This means you will have to double Hamlet, which is Anthology 4. Now our code is 81523. â81523âTwo youths shed tears for 3â; this refers to Romeo and Juliet, so you must replace 1 with 3. Our code now is 83523. Finally, â3 witches disappearâ (reference to Macbeth), which is Anthology 3. Youâll have to remove it from the code. The final pass code is 8352.\n9. Enter the code on the door to unlock it. The puzzle in hard mode does not randomize; the code will always be 8352 on any Silent Hill 3 game.\n"

    "output": "Smooth edges. Clean streets. People bustle about, heading to lunch, with smiles on their faces. Posters line the walls of the city saying \"Be Your Brother's Keeper\" or \"Arcadia is Our Mother\". Loudspeakers chime in with daily reminders about citywide  events or milestones met. \"Without Arcadia,\" says the woman on the announcements, \"we are nothing.\" Police in crisp white uniforms patrol the streets on foot, and everyone smiles and nods at them. Above, through the small clouds, an impossibly tall tower can be seen standing at the center of the sprawl.\nA great wall surrounds the city. The First Founders began building it long ago, during their age, and by the time their generation had passed it was finished. A dull grey barrier, blocking Arcadia off from the outside world. Every man, woman, and child knows what lies beyond. Ruins of the fallen world, the world that came before. Anyone is free to leave, but such a thought rarely ever crosses the mind. They are taught the truth when they are young, how societies collapsed after fossil fuels ran out. How wars were fought not for land, but for water. How the nuclear missiles, the Dust Makers, were made. How terrifyingly destructive they had been. How they had sailed through the air like shooting stars before crashing back down to Earth like meteors.\nThey picked through the ashes and learned from their ancestor's mistakes. They come together as a community, and stay together as a community, for each other's sake. Division, the teachers said, is what split the old world apart. People were separated, not just by the borders of their country, but by the borders they made themselves. Race. Class. Religion. Political views. In Arcadia, these things still exist, but the people are taught to embrace their difference. To cherish it. To not let it consume and divide them.\nBecause if there is division, there is no Arcadia. And without Arcadia, they are nothing."

They have been saying things like \"the methods used in the paper are abysmal\" and \"the authors use an outdated and archaic method, which is also very uncertain, to measure the mass of the frogs, which is by weighting them on a scale\". I am not sure how to respond to these comments. I would like to know what you would do if you were in my position.",
    "output": "Based on the description, I would advise you to sleep on it, suck it up, respond to the reviewers, revise the paper, and submit your revision to the journal.\nYes, reviewers can be absolutely, disgustingly, and unnecessarily rude and mean. Read their review, filter their non-technical rants, keep whatever helpful criticism you can extract from their comments, and address them nicely and respectfully. It may actually be that the techniques you used were adequate but you failed to point out why and how it would be unnecessary to use more expensive methods. Always assume that they are right. If they are mistaken, respectfully point out in your response why you are right and edit the original manuscript to make the issue clearer to future readers.\n\nFor instance, if the reviewer wrote:\n\n> The methods used in the paper are abysmal. The authors use an outdated and archaic method, which is also very uncertain, to measure the mass of the frogs, which is by weighting them on a scale. The atomic mass interferometer, which uses gravitational waves and is able to precisely infer mass with an uncertainty of one atomic mass unit per kilogram, is the state of the art in weighting.\n\nYou can write as a response:\n\n* The reviewer is absolutely correct that atomic mass interferometry (AMI) is the state of the art in weighting. However, we opted to use analytical scales to measure the mass of the frogs because the mass variations that we expected to measure are of at least 1 g, a quantity signficantly higher than the uncertainty of even the most rudimentary analytical scales. We do, however, agree, that the quantum mechanical analysis of the molecular buildup in neural entangled channels in during frog electrophoresis, which is suggested as an interesting prospective investigation, will benefit from the low uncertainty provided by AMI. In order to make it clear that the methods used in our study were adequate, we have modified the original manuscript to include the following sentence in the second paragraph of page 5: While there are more precise methods to infer mass, such as atomic mass interferometry, analytical scales offer accuracies that are compatible with the 1 g mass variations that were found in this study (see Table 3, for instance)."

    "input": " Why do Arabic words like \"Kuwait\" and \"Qatar\" get written with a \"K\" and a \"Q\" in English?",
    "output": "In Arabic, in fact, they've always been separate sounds! The sound we write \"K\" is spelled with the letter Ù in Arabic, and is pronounced a little bit further forward in the mouth; the sound we write \"Q\" is spelled with the letter Ù and pronounced a little bit farther back. In phonetic terms, \"K\" is a velar sound, and \"Q\" is a uvular sound.\n\nEnglish doesn't distinguish between these two different sounds. But since we've got a spare letter lying aroundâthe English letter \"Q\" is actually related to the Arabic letter Ù, if you go back far enough!âit's become conventional to separate them in writing. \"Kuwait\" is spelled with a Ù, so it gets a \"K\"; \"Qatar\" is spelled with a Ù, so it gets a \"Q\". The \"Qur'an\", similarly, has a Ù in it.\n\nNowadays, by the way, the letter \"Q\" has started to be associated with Arabic in particular, since it shows up significantly more there than in English. So in pop culture, you'll sometimes see names like \"Hakeem\" respelled to \"Haqim\"âeven though the original Arabic has a Ù in it! Linguistically, this is called hypercorrection, and it's the same reason you'll see words like \"fortÃ©\" with an Ã©: English-speakers associate the acute accent with Romance loans (cafÃ©, fiancÃ©, rÃ©sumÃ©), but it has no special meaning in English, so it sometimes gets inserted where it doesn't actually belong (the original Italian word is simply forte)."

    "input": " What is the \"cards speak\" rule in casinos?",
    "output": "Casinos in the US generally have the \"cards speak\" rule. That is, when a hand is properly tabled--exposed to everyone at showdown--it is the responsibility of all players, the dealer, floormen, and anyone else present to see that the pot is awarded to the best hand shown, regardless of what the players might say.\n\nSome players object to this rule: they believe that if a player or railbird says \"Wait, Bob has a flush\", that's unfairly helping a player. But the rule is clear: once the hand is tabled, others have not only the right but the obligation to help ensure the pot is awarded correctly.\n\nThere are a couple of caveats: if a player only shows his hand to another player, or to the dealer, or to any other person, without properly tabling it for everyone, that player has no rights yet and those to whom the hand was shown should remain silent to protect other players' properly shown hands. But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands.\n\nFinally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand. Some California lowball clubs even had a rule that a player who remained silent rather than explicitly calling out a pair could be ruled against in this way."

    "output": "Python provides two ways to sort a list, the built-in list method `list.sort()` and the built-in function `sorted()`.\n\nThe primary difference between the two is that list.sort() will sort the list in-place, mutating its indexes and returning None, whereas sorted() will return a new sorted list leaving the original list unchanged. Another difference is that sorted() accepts any iterable while list.sort() is a method of the list class and can only be used with lists. \n\nHere is an example of using `list.sort()`:\n\n```\n# the list to be sorted\nx = [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 4, 8]\n\n# sort by list.sort()\nx.sort()\nprint(x)\n```\n\nThe output of the above code is \n```\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nEquivalently, you can use `sorted()`:\n\n```\nsorted_x = sorted(x)\n```"

    "input": " How much propellant is left in a rocket booster when it is shut down?",
    "output": "First stages are generally run to depletion (though not complete depletion). First stage ascents often use a preprogrammed, open loop guidance system to get out of the atmosphere with a good chunk of downrange velocity. Because winds aloft and other factors may vary, first stage performance also varies somewhat.\nUpper stage guidance is almost always closed loop, targeting a specific position and velocity combination. As a result, upper stages of boosters are shut down when that target is reached, with some amount of reserve propellants left to cover dispersions during ascent and a disposal burn.\nLiquid fueled first stages are not run dry. Cutoff is triggered with some amount left in the tank. This is because the turbopumps operate at ridiculous velocities and need something to pump, at a specific inlet pressure. The heat source (gas generator, expander, or preburner) that drives the pump is downstream of the inlet in the flow path, so cutoff has to happen by cutting off the drive force to the pump before the inlet loses pressure or runs dry. \nIf that pressure drops below minimum specifications or if the inlet goes dry, you will get cavitation and/or overspeed conditions, both of which would result in a violent reconfiguration of the hardware.\nSolid lower stages are much simpler in this regard. At some point, the thrust will tail off until the booster no longer supports its own weight. At that point, it is jettisoned."

    "output": "Sure, here is a story using facts provided:\n\nFollowing the events of the first film, Ning (Leslie Cheung) parts ways with the Taoist Yin (Wu Ma) and returns to his home village, which has since fallen on desperate times. Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel. Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn (Jacky Cheung), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy (Joey Wong) and Moon (Michelle Reis) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu. The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu (Waise Lee). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father. Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk. The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away. The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving. In the desert, as Yin and Ning are about to continue their journey, they see two women approach on horseback, which happen to be Windy and Moon. Windy has escaped from her wedding and decides to leave with Ning."

    "input": " How can I help end homelessness?",
    "output": "Homelessness can feel like a daunting problem, especially as the population grows and living costs continue to rise. Helping to end homelessness will ensure no one has to go without a permanent, stable place to live. Give back to homeless organizations and participate in events that focus on ending homelessness. Advocating for changes to policies and laws around homelessness and treating homeless people with respect can also help to address this important issue.\n\n## Support homeless organizations and group\n\n1. Volunteer your time to a local homeless shelter. Start small by volunteering weekly or monthly at a homeless shelter in your area. Sign up to volunteer to serve food to the homeless or to create care packages for the homeless. You may challenge yourself to volunteer for 2-4 hours a week or twice a month. Or you may devote time during the holidays to work at a homeless shelter. Enlist friends or family to volunteer with you at a homeless shelter.\n2. Donate your skills to a non-profit organization that focuses on homelessness. Search for non-profit groups and organizations that work on initiatives for ending homelessness in your area. Contact them and offer to help them in any way you can. Put skills you already have to good use by donating them to the organization. For example, if you have coding skills, you may offer to update the organizationâs website. Or if you love talking to people, you may offer to work in a call center or go door to door to promote the non-profit organization.\n3. Give monetary donations to homeless groups and organizations. Donating money to homeless organizations can go a long way to helping with this issue. You may give a large sum once a year to a specific program for the homeless or to the organization as whole. Regular giving, where you give a small amount once weekly or once a month, can also help. Donate to a homeless organization as a gift for a friend or in memory of someone close to you. Make a holiday donation to the organization as a way to give back. Raise money for these organizations by setting up a fundraiser online for them or by asking others for donations.\n4. Go to fundraisers for homeless organizations. Show your support for ending homelessness by attending fundraisers and events that address the issue. Check your local community board for events to raise funds for a local homeless shelter or drop in center. Find out if there are fundraisers in your area that you can donate time or money to. Donate an item for a silent auction at an event for the homeless. Bid on items to help raise money for the issue. Invite friends and family to fundraisers to benefit the homeless so they can participate as well.\n5. Participate in food and clothing drives for the homeless. Donate clothing or food for the drive. Volunteer to collect food and clothing for the drive. Promote the food and clothing drive on social media to get others to donate. Warm coats, socks, scarves, and hats are all good options for a clothing drive. Non-perishable food like canned goods, crackers, and granola bars are ideal donations for a food drive. Most communities will run annual food and clothing drives, especially around Christmas time when the weather is cold and homeless people need more support. Check your community board or at your community center for information on upcoming food or clothing drives. Your school or your church may also run a food and clothing drive for the homeless.\n\n\n## Advocate for homeless policies and laws\n\n1. Write or call your government representative about ending homelessness. Many long term solutions for homelessness require changes to existing policies and laws. Contact your representative in government and ask them what they are doing to help end homelessness. Remind them that homelessness is an important issue that their constituents care about and want to address. Search online for contact information for your government representative. Calling them directly will be more effective than writing a letter. Messaging them publicly on social media can also be effective. For example, you may write to your mayor or you may contact your senator. You can also reach out to city council members to find out how they plan to address the issue. In your letter or call, advocate for more investment in affordable housing and social services to help prevent homelessness. Discuss the need for services that help homeless people find permanent homes and stay off the street. Note the need for counseling and rehabilitation centers for homeless people with addiction issues so they can get better and find employment.\n2. Support political candidates that care about ending homelessness. Put your right to vote to work by only supporting candidates who discuss ending homelessness in their platforms and during their campaigns. Promote them on social media and volunteer for their campaign. Cast your vote for them on election day. Tell friends and family about political candidates who discuss ending homelessness so they can stay informed and vote.\n3. Organize a march or protest that focuses on support for the homeless. Let others know about this important issue by organizing a march or a peaceful protest that focuses on ending homelessness. Invite friends, family members, and colleagues to the march. Promote the march or protest on social media so others can participate. Make signs that note the importance of ending homelessness and bring them to the march. Use a megaphone at the protest to give speeches about the issue. Have the march or protest in a public space, such as in front of a government building or in a public square.\n4. Work towards a career as a politician, lobbyist, or non-profit worker. Do well in your social studies and history classes in high school. Join a school debate team or public speaking club to get better at these skills. Take classes in political science, history, and conflict resolution in university. Get involved in local politics and non-profit organizations. Apply to positions as a lobbyist or a non-profit worker so you can work to actively end homelessness on a day to day basis. Run for local office with a platform that focuses on ending homelessness in your community.\n\n\n## Treat homeless people with respect\n\n1. Acknowledge the homeless person with a smile or nod. Rather than rushing by them without looking at them, make eye contact and smile or nod at them. Let them know that you see them and acknowledge them as a person. This is a small way for you to show empathy for them. Avoid yelling, shouting, or mocking the homeless person, as this will only make them feel more alienated and alone. Treat them like a friend or family member, showing care and respect for them.\n2. Try starting a conversation with the homeless person. Ask them how they are doing. Find out where they are from. Keep the conversation open and friendly. Maintain eye contact when you talk to them so they know you care. For example, you may say, âHow are you today?â or âWhere are you from originally?â\n\t* If the homeless person does not seem interested in answering your questions, donât pressure them into answering. Let them decide if they want to engage with you on a deeper level.\n3. Offer to buy the homeless person a meal. If you have the time and funds, offer to grab the person a cup of coffee or a sandwich from somewhere nearby. Getting the person a warm meal may make their day and help them feel less down about their situation. The meal does not have to be elaborate or expensive. A cup of coffee or a small snack would likely be appreciated by the person.\n4. Give the homeless person a care package. Prepare a care package that contains important items like socks, warm gloves, toothpaste, lip balm, and non-perishable food like crackers or nuts. Give out the care packages to homeless people in your area so they have supplies that they need. Make it a habit to hand out care packages to homeless people once a month or regularly during the winter months.\n5. Decide to give the person money if you feel comfortable. Giving money to a homeless person is a personal preference and completely up to you. Handing change or a few bucks to a homeless person can be a demonstration of empathy and help them in a very direct way. You may decide to give the person a meal, rather than money. Or you may sometimes give the person money and offer them food other times.\n"

    "input": " What is a staph infection?",
    "output": "Staphylococcus bacteria are commonly found on human skin and many surfaces. When the bacteria stays on your skin, it's generally fine; however, if the bacteria enters the skin through a cut, scrape, or bug bite, it can cause problems. It can create an infected wound, and if left untreated, can become life-threatening.[1]\nX\nTrustworthy Source\nMayo Clinic\nEducational website from one of the world's leading hospitals\nGo to source\n Seeing your doctor for treatment is a must if you think you have a staph infection.\n\n## Get treatment\n\n1. Look for signs of infection. A staph infection can show redness and swelling. It can also create pus. In fact, it can look much like a spider bite. The skin may also feel warm. These symptoms will generally be near where you have a cut or sore. There may also be pus or discharge draining from the wound.\n2. Seek professional medical attention as soon as possible. Staph infections can develop into a serious infection quickly. Therefore, if you think you have one, you should call your doctor. Your doctor will likely want you to come in as soon as possible, and she will give you instructions for the immediate future. If you have signs of infection as well as a fever, it is especially important you see your doctor. Your doctor may wish to see you immediately or send you to the emergency room for treatment.\n3. Clean the area with an antibiotic soap. In warm water, gently wash the area with soap. You can use a washcloth if you do so gently, but you shouldn't use that washcloth again before washing it. Don't try to pop the wound if it's a blister; that will only spread infection. If your wound needs to be drained, it should be done a by doctor. Make sure to wash your hands after cleaning the area. When you dry the wound, use a clean towel. Don't reuse it without washing it.\n4. Discuss whether your doctor will take a sample. Generally, your doctor will want to analyze a sample of tissue or a culture. The idea is he can check what strain of the infection you have; once identified, he will know which antibiotic that particular microbe is susceptible to.\n5. Expect your doctor to drain it. If you have a bad infection that creates an abscess or boil, your doctor will likely drain the pus from wound. You shouldn't feel much, as she will try to numb the area first. Draining a wound generally involves the doctor using a scalpel to make a small incision across it. After that, she'll let fluid drain out. If the wound is large, she may pack it with gauze that will need to be removed at a later time.\n6. Ask about antibiotics. Most of the time with staph infection, you will need to take a round of antibiotics. One reason staph is so dangerous is because some strains are becoming resistant to certain types of antibiotics. This includes Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which must be treated with IV antibiotics. Typically, you'd take cephalosporins, nafcillin, or sulfa drugs; however, you may need to take vancomycin instead, which is less resistant. The downside to this drug is your doctor must give it to you intravenously. A side effect of vancomycin may be the development of a severe, itch rash. It usually covers the neck, face, and upper torso. You cannot simply look at an infection and know that it is a staph or MRSA\n7. Understand when surgery is necessary. Sometimes, staph infections can develop around a medical device implanted in your body or a prosthetic. If that happens, you may need surgery to have the device removed.\n8. Watch for this complication with other injuries. Staph infections can be a problem in a number of situations, such as when you have surgery. You can also develop a serious condition called septic arthritis when staph bacteria enter a joint, which can happen sometimes when staph is in the bloodstream. If you have septic arthritis, you'll have trouble using that joint; you'll also likely notice quite a bit of pain, as well as some swelling and redness. You should see a doctor as soon as possible if you have these symptoms.\n\n\n## Prevent staph infections\n\n1. Wash your hands often. Staph gathers on the skin, including under your nails. By washing your hands, you are more likely to avoid introducing it to a scratch, scrape, or scab. When you wash your hands, you should scrub for 20 to 30 seconds with soap and warm water; using a throwaway towel afterwards is best. In addition, turn off the faucet with a towel so you don't touch the germy surface after washing your hands.\n2. Clean and cover cuts. When you get a cut or scrape, it's important to cover it with a bandage once you clean it up. Using an antibiotic ointment is also good practice. Doing so will help keep staph infection out of the wound.\n3. Wear gloves if you need to play doctor. If you're working on someone else's cut or wound, it's best to put on clean gloves if possible. If not, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards and try not to touch the wound itself with your bare hands. You can do things like put the antibiotic ointment on the bandage before placing it over the wound to keep from touching it.\n4. Shower after you exercise. You can pick up staph infection in the gym, hot tub, or steam room, so make sure to shower after you exercise to help wash it off. Always make sure the shower area is clean, and don't share shower supplies, such as razors, towels, and soap.\n5. Change tampons frequently. Toxic shock syndrome is a form of staph infection, and it is often caused by leaving a tampon in for longer than eight hours. Try to change your tampon every four to eight hours, and use the lightest tampon you can get away with. If you use a tampon that is too absorbent, it can increase your risk of a staph infection. If you're worried about toxic shock syndrome, try sticking to other methods to manage your period, such as pads.\n6. Increase the temperature. When doing your laundry, wash your linens, including your towels and sheets, in hot water. Hot water can help kill off the staph bacteria so it doesn't keep infecting you.\n"

    "output": "Safely remove/overwrite only bothersome files\nWhen you want to ```merge```:\n```git checkout -f donor-branch   # replace bothersome files with tracked versions\ngit checkout receiving-branch  # tracked bothersome files disappear\ngit merge donor-branch         # merge works\n```\nWhen you want to ```pull```:\n```git fetch\ngit checkout -f origin/mybranch   # replace bothersome files with tracked versions\ngit checkout mybranch             # tracked bothersome files disappear\ngit pull origin/mybranch          # pull works\n```\nThat's all you need to know to use this. Below is an explanation.\n\nDetailed explanation\nThe Bothersome Files that we are going to remove:\n\n* exist in the donor branch (for ```git pull```: the upstream branch),\n* do not exist in the receiving branch,\n* and are blocking the merge because they are present and untracked in your working directory.\n\n```git merge -f``` and ```git pull -f``` do not exist, but ```git checkout -f``` does.\nWe will use ```git checkout -f``` + ```git checkout``` to track + remove the Bothersome Files, and then your merge can proceed normally.\nStep 1. This step forcibly replaces untracked Bothersome Files with tracked versions of the donor branch (it also checks out the donor branch, and updates the rest of the working dir).\n```git checkout -f donor-branch\n```\nStep 2. This step removes the Bothersome Files because they they are tracked in our current (donor) branch, and absent in the ```receiving-branch``` we switch to.\n```git checkout receiving-branch\n```\nStep 3.

    "input": " Why does the Android bootloader wipe the data on the device when it is unlocked?",
    "output": "It's a security concern. The Android documentation doesn't provide a lot of elaboration, stating simply:\n\n  The procedure must be confirmed on-screen, and deletes the user data for privacy reasons.\n\nHowever, the privacy concern is relatively straightforward to extrapolate. Once the bootloader is unlocked, the device can be flashed with unsigned images. This means that it is relatively trivial to root the device, and there are actually multiple ways it can be done, such as:\n\n* Flashing a system image with root tools built in\n* Flashing a boot image that runs ```adbd``` with root by default (an \"unsecure\" image)\n* Flashing a recovery image, then using that to overwrite the system or boot partitions with ones that allow root access\n\nOnce root is obtained, all of the information on ```/data``` essentially becomes accessible. This could be emails, contact information, or many other pieces of personal information that you likely don't want in the wrong hands. \n\nTherefore, it makes sense to wipe all of this data during the unlocking procedure to ensure that there is no off-the-shelf \"official\" way of bypassing the sandboxing restrictions implemented by the Android operating system, which would thereby allow someone to steal personal data.\n\nOf course, there may be ways to root without wiping on some devices, but they rely on exploits rather than official methods like a bootloader unlock, meaning they are basically bugs."

Elas podem fazer as mesmas coisas, e todos os membros estÃ£o disponÃ­veis em qualquer um deles, afinal assim se comporta um alias.\nDiferenÃ§as Ãºteis na utilizaÃ§Ã£o e escolha:\n\n* ```string``` Ã© apenas uma forma mais simples de usar o tipo ```String``` no C#, ou seja, ```string``` Ã© a forma de &quot;tipar&quot; uma cadeia de caracteres no C# e ```String``` Ã© um tipo do CLR. No C#, dependendo do contexto, Ã© melhor usar uma ou outra forma. O tipo ```String``` presente no namespace ```System``` pode ser usado em qualquer linguagem que se utilize do CLR.\n\n* ```string``` nÃ£o pode ser usado com reflexÃ£o. ```String``` deve ser usado no lugar.\n\n* ```String``` pode ser usado para criar outros aliases:\n``` using str = System.String;\n //...\n str s = &quot;Foi usado outro alias para string.&quot;;\n // a variÃ¡vel 's' Ã© do tipo System.String que Ã© o mesmo que ser string\n```\nMas esse Ã© apenas um exemplo, nÃ£o hÃ¡ necessidade e nÃ£o Ã© recomendado usar em cÃ³digo real.

    "output": "Mormon services are a bit different, as you discovered. In the United States, there is generally a block of 3 meetings back-to-back including a sunday school, a mens' and women's time for instruction, and a sacrament meeting where the general congregation meets together. It sounds like the first meeting you attended was Priesthood meeting where the brothers study the words of scripture and modern Church leaders. Those classes usually have a single instructor each week.\n\nSacrament meeting is where any equivalence of a sermon would be heard. The primary difference between Mormon services and some others is the focal event of church meetings. The purpose behind holding a sacrament meeting is to take the sacrament and renew covenants made at baptism. The actual administration of the sacrament is the most sacred public meeting to Mormons. Hearing people speak and even interpersonal communion (socializing) is only secondary, though important.\n\nMembers of a ward, or local congregation, are invited to speak by the bishop or his counselors (the basic equivalent of a pastor) and will have some time to prepare a talk. Talks should draw from the scriptures, personal experience and testimony, and focus on the Savior. Note that comments made by church members over the pulpit at a sacrament meeting do not necessarily reflect the Church's official position on a topic or even Church doctrine.\nThe talks are meant to urge, inspire, and exhort all in attendance to come to Christ, to give them an opportunity to feel the power of the Spirit, and to strengthen their faith. Often, members will come with questions in their hearts and find answers in the words that day.\n\nCounsel from leaders like a bishop sometimes occur over the pulpit, but usually this is private and individual, based on personal circumstances. The bishop and his counselors are supposed to meet with members regularly in interviews. There is no paid clergy, so all the service is volunteer.\n\nEach member is also assigned two \"home teachers\" which visit their family once a month to share a gospel message, check on well-being, and be a friend and support especially when needed. In this way, instruction is given which might also help replace a typical sermon pattern. The bishop, his counselors, and others he calls on help organize these efforts. (It has also proven to be very quick and effective during disaster response, as home teachers immediately report in on who they teach, and bishops coordinate an effort if needed.\n\nSo what you saw was apparently quite normal. Even once a month (the first Sunday), a fast and testimony meeting is held during sacrament meeting, where members forgo preparing talks and instead bear their testimonies about Christ and the gospel for the hour as they feel a desire to do so. Instruction is very member-to-member, you might say, but is guided by the direction of a bishop and other church leaders who also inspire and instruct."

    "input": " What is the difference between an NPC and a Bot?",
    "output": "The key distinction is that a Bot represents an automated player; an NPC, by contrast, isn't playing the game at all.\n\nIn general, an NPC is a part of the game; a placed object which is designed by the creator and exists to interact with the player. Examples would include vendors, quest givers, or enemies. In some games, (particularly RPG's), the term is also used to refer to characters under the control of, but not generated by the player. They are often distinguished by having distinct personalities and dialog, whereas a \"\"Player Character\"\" is meant as more of an extension of the player themselves. Think of the companion party members in the Mass Effect series for an example.\n\nA Bot, by contrast, is essentially a player of the game controlled by a computer. This can be populated within a single instance, as a feature in some games (i.e. AI opponents in a normally multiplayer game), or, in some cases, actually represents a separate instance of the application running on a networked computer and being controlled by some manner of AI script (as is common in many MMO's, much to the dismay of the communities playing the game). The term 'Bot' is also often used to refer to software used to enhance or replace the skills of a human player of the game; for example, an 'Aim-Bot' that handles targeting, or a 'Farming Bot' in an MMO that performs tedious or menial tasks. Such bots are usually (though not always), considered cheating and a violation of the Terms of Service of the game in question."

    "input": " How do I pay my property taxes online?",
    "output": "If you own real property (a home or land) in the United States, you are responsible for paying state property taxes each year. While these taxes are assessed through the county where the property is located, most counties in each state allow property owners to pay their taxes online. The specific information you need to pay your property taxes online depends on where your property is located.\n\n## Calculate your payments\n\n1. Look on your tax bill. You should receive an annual property tax statement in the mail that provides information about the amount of tax you owe each year. This statement also has other information, such as a property identification number or PIN, that may be necessary for you to pay your taxes online. Your tax bill may not include any delinquent taxes, or any other tax assessments, such as supplemental taxes. Those typically are sent separately.\n2. Check online if you haven't received a bill. Just because you don't receive a bill doesn't mean you don't owe property taxes. In most states and counties, you can find out how much tax you owe by going to your state or county's property tax website. The amount of tax online typically will be more up to date than what's on your bill, so even if you have your bill handy you may want to check online. If there's a discrepancy, go by the amount online rather than the amount on your bill. Unfortunately, you may need a PIN or identification number located on the bill to access your tax amount online.\n3. Call the tax assessor's office if you need more information. If you haven't received a bill and can't find the amount you owe on the website, you can always call the tax assessor's office and ask. The clerk should be able to give you the total amount of property tax you owe, as well as any other information you need, such as a PIN, so you can pay your taxes online.\n4. Confirm the types of property tax you owe. Some states or counties may have different types of property taxes that you'll have to pay. You may have to check for different types separately. For example, in California you may have secured and unsecured property taxes. Unsecured property taxes are taxes on watercraft, airplanes, or temporary fixtures that are not connected to real property. These may be listed separately, or included on separate websites. Depending on where you live, certain types of property taxes may not be included in the online information. For example, the property tax website for Cook County, Illinois, does not include amounts for back taxes, air pollution taxes, and some other types of property taxes.\n5. Confirm due dates for taxes owed. On the tax assessor's website, you'll find information about the dates property taxes are due each year. If you have any delinquent taxes, they typically are considered due immediately. If you pay your taxes on or before the due dates you'll avoid penalties, interest, and other fees. Plan ahead, especially if you won't be able to pay the total amount all at once.\n6. Determine how much of your taxes you can pay. Particularly if you have delinquent taxes, you may not be able to pay all of your taxes at once. Access the website well before the due date, if possible, so you can budget for your payments accordingly.\n7. Check to see if your mortgage company is paying your property taxes. If you have a mortgage on your property, your monthly mortgage payment may include an escrow amount that goes to pay your property taxes. When property taxes are due, your mortgage company will withdraw the money from the escrow account and pay them on your behalf. You typically still will get a bill or property tax statement, even though you don't owe anything. Check with your mortgage company if you're not sure so you don't end up paying twice.\n\n\n## Make your payments\n\n1. Visit your county or state's property tax website. Property taxes are assessed by county governments. The easiest way to find your county's property tax website is to check on your state's website for a link. Your state will have a .gov web address, so you can be assured that the link you find from the state website is the legitimate website for your county. This way you can make sure you keep all your information secure.\n2. Enter information for your property. The information you need to enter to access your account and pay your taxes online differs among states and counties. Typically you'll have a PIN or property identification number that you must enter to correctly find your property. A street address typically isn't enough, because property may be assessed using parcel numbers or some other system of organization.\n3. Do a search for your property. Some property tax assessors may allow you to look up the property identification number you need on the website itself. Others may require you to call the county tax assessor's office to get the information you need. If you don't have the information you need, look for a link that will allow you to search for your property. When you click on the link to pay your taxes, there should be a link close to the space where you would enter the information that you can follow to get the information you need.\n4. Review acceptable methods of payment. Depending on the county, different methods of payment are accepted if you want to pay your property taxes online. Some methods of payment may come with an additional fee. If you pay using an electronic check, you typically won't have to pay a fee. Using a debit or credit card may incur a fee ranging from a few dollars to 2 or 3 percent of the amount of your payment.\n5. Make your payment. Once you've entered the information you need and chosen your method of payment, simply enter the amount of money you want to pay along with your payment information to pay your property taxes online.\n6. Print your confirmation. Once you've submitted your payment, you'll typically get a confirmation screen that will include a unique confirmation number and an option to print the page for your records. You may also get a confirmation through email. If you get an email confirmation you don't necessarily have to print a paper copy, just make sure to save the email.\n\n\n## Use other online resources\n\n1. Create a portfolio. If you own several parcels of property in the same state or county, you may be able to create a portfolio of properties on your state or county's property tax website. The portfolio allows you to manage all of your property taxes in one place. Look for a link on the property tax page that will allow you to create a portfolio, and follow the instructions. If you don't see a link, look for a FAQ page and see if anything is listed about how to link multiple properties.\n2. Set up recurring payments. Some states and counties allow you to enter payment information once and schedule payments, which are automatically deducted from your bank account or credit card. If you have the option to schedule payments, this can be helpful with budgeting. You can schedule a partial payment each month so you don't have to pay the whole thing all at once. Mark your payment dates on your calendar or set a reminder on your phone so you don't forget that the payment is coming out.\n3. Subscribe to email notifications. Some counties provide email notifications that will alert you before the due date for property taxes, or when there have been changes to your account. If you weren't able to set up recurring payments, these notifications can help you ensure you don't miss a due date and incur additional penalties and fees. If you subscribe to email notifications, you may want to add the email address to your contacts list or preferred addresses list. This will ensure you actually receive the notifications and they don't fall into your spam folder.\n4. Apply for a payment plan. Most counties allow you to set up a payment plan if you have delinquent property taxes. You typically have to fill out an application, and may be subject to a credit check. Some counties also allow payment plans even if your taxes are current, if you anticipate you won't be able to pay the amount in full by the due date. If this option is available to you, it can save you in potential late fees and penalties. A payment plan typically requires the payments to be automatically debited from your bank account.\n"

Here are some suggestions for your two-day itinerary:\n\nDay 1:\n\n*  Sightseeing guideline: White House (1 hour) â Washington Monument (1 hour) â National WWII Memorial (1 hour) â Lincoln Memorial (1 hour) â Jefferson Memorial (0.5 hours)\nThe first dayâs tour begins from the iconic White House, where visitors can explore the historic and cultural heart of American politics by visiting the monuments, Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, and the beautiful Tidal Basin.\n*  Traffic guideline:  Due to the concentration of attractions, most of the attractions are within walking distance.\n*  Catering Guideline: Around the White House and Capitol Hill, there are fewer options, with fast food restaurants being predominant, but there are also some unique restaurants offering Mediterranean, Asian, and other international cuisines worth trying.\n\nWith extensive routes covering the entire city, riding the metro is the best option for getting around, with peak fares ranging from $2.15 to $5.90, and off-peak fares ranging from $1.75 to $3.60. Tourists can also purchase a One Day Pass ($14 per ticket) at any metro station, which is valid for both metro and buses.\n\n\nDay 2:\n\n*  Sightseeing guideline: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (2 hours) â National Gallery of Art (2 hours) â Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (2 hours) â U.S. Capitol (1 hour)\nOn the second day, visit some of Washington D.C.'s most famous museums to experience nature, history, art, and aerospace technology in an all-encompassing way, and then proceed to the majestic U.S. Capitol, the highest legislative body.\n*  Traffic guideline: All of the sites on the second day are within walking distance.  Tourists can also purchase a One Day Pass ($14 per ticket) at any metro station, which is valid for both metro and buses.\n*  Catering Guideline: As a diverse metropolis and political center, Washington D.C. offers a wide range of dining options. You can visit the Northwest areas such as Georgetown, Dupont Circle, and Adams Morgan where the majority of restaurants are located.\n\nIn general, the attractions in Washington D.C. are very concentrated, and most of them are within walking distance of each other, making it very convenient. Additionally, most of the attractions do not require tickets, but some may have strict security checks, so be mindful of the items you carry. In spring, you can also enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms in Washington D.C.."

    "output": "First, please keep in mind that the number of questions on the public forum doesn't give any indication of how common such issues are, since people usually only post when something is wrong. We don't hear about all the cases where everything is fine. It is unclear why math advisors should inherently be better people than in any other field, and there is no empirical evidence that warrants this. However, a few of the specific issues you mention are perhaps less likely to arise in mathematics, due to cultural and structural reasons.\n\n>\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\nIn the US, at least, the main avenue of funding for math graduate students is through teaching assistantships, since math departments teach a large number of service courses. Faculty who have grants can sometimes offer their students a research assistantship instead, so that the student doesn't have to teach. But a student really isn't completely reliant on their advisor for funding. Moreover, there typically aren't major expenses for the research itself (no expensive equipment, etc), so as long as the student is getting paid, research can continue.\n(This is not necessarily the case in other countries.)\n\n>\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\nThe general practice in mathematics is that all authors are listed alphabetically, and the concept of \"first authorship\" does not exist. As such, people don't bother to keep track of who did the \"majority\" of the work. Thus this particular issue doesn't arise in mathematics.\n\n>\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\nWhile individual departments may vary, I think there's a general sense in mathematics that a joint paper \"counts\" about the same as a solo paper. As such, if a student has contributed to a project, the advisor has no particular incentive not to include them as an author on the paper.\n\n>\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\n\nAs above, it isn't any particular disadvantageous to a student if another student is added."

    "output": "In fact, the English expression for a burdensome gift is literally white elephant:\n\n> a thing that is useless and no longer needed, although it may have cost a lot of money [OALD]\n\nSo-called white elephants, or albino elephants, are found in many parts of South and Southeast Asia. In Buddhist countries they may be venerated as Queen Maya, mother of the Buddha, was said to have been visited in a dream by a white elephant holding a white lotus flower, and Siddharth Gautama entered his mother's womb in the form a white elephant. The white elephant is also associated with traits like mental strength and purity.\nIt became a royal symbol in Siam (Thailand); the king continues to keep  white elephants. The story emerged that if a courtier displeased him, the king would make him a gift of a white elephant. The courtier could hardly decline a royal gift, and could hardly afford not to maintain a sacred animal, and could not put it to productive use, and so would be ruined by the cost of upkeep.\nThe earliest example of its use is from a 1721 essay in London Journal:\n\n  In short, Honour and Victory are generally no more than white Elephants; and for white Elephants the most destructive Wars have been often made.\n\nA 2011 paper by Ross Bullen entitled âThis Alarming Generosityâ: White Elephants and the Logic of the Gift, in American Literature, covers the popularization of the term in the mid-19th century, presents an alternative account, that the story is a piece of orientalism and the white elephant rose as a literary trope."

    "input": " Why don't elves have more children?",
    "output": "Tolkien himself addresses this in an essay called &quot;Laws and Customs Among the Eldar&quot;. There are essentially two problems:\n\n* Elvish libido diminishes over time. Contrary to popular belief (and outward appearance, from a human perspective), Elves do age; and as they get older, they get less interested in procreation.\n* Having children is exhausting. The Elves believe that their child-bearing process draws a heavier physical and spiritual toll on them, compared to what it does to humans. They're understandable reluctant to have a lot of kids, because what's the point in having a dozen kids if doing so might literally kill you?\n\nFrom &quot;Laws and Customs&quot;:\n\nIt might be thought that, since the Eldar do not (as Men deem) grow old in body, they may bring forth children at any time in the ages of their lives. But this is not so. For the Eldar do indeed grow older, even if slowly: the limit of their lives is the life of Arda, which though long beyond the reckoning of Men is not endless, and ages also. Moreover their body and spirit are not separated but coherent. As the weight of the years, with all their changes of desire and thought, gathers upon the spirit of the Eldar, so do the impulses and moods of their bodies change. [...]\nAlso the Eldar say that in the begetting [conceiving], and still more in the bearing of children, greater share and strength of their being, in mind and in body, goes forth than in the making of mortal children. For these reasons it came to pass that the Eldar brought forth few children; and also that their time of generation was in their youth or earlier life, unless strange and hard fates befell them.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n\nThat last point about the toll on their mind and body is worth expanding on, and fortunately Tolkien does this later in the essay:\n\n[A]ll the Eldar, being aware of it in themselves, spoke of the passing of much strength, both of mind and of body, into their children, in bearing and begetting. Therefore they hold that the fÃ«a [soul], though unbegotten, draws nourishment directly from the fÃ«a of the mother while she bears and nourishes the hrondo [body; later changed to the word hroÃ¤], and mediately but equally from the father, whose fÃ«a is bound in union with the mother's and supports it.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n"

    "output": "These are a few extra points to complement Andrew Rosen's comprehensive response:\n\n* To be absolutely clear, typical DFT calculations are not performed at 0K, a better description of what happens is that they are performed \"for a static crystal\". Static crystal means that the atoms are fixed at their crystallographic positions (which is what a typical DFT calculation does), but this situation is different from 0K. Even at 0K, the atomic nuclei move due to quantum zero-point motion (also called quantum fluctuations). This quantum zero-point motion is very small for compounds containing heavy elements, which means that in these cases \"0K\" and \"static crystal\" are almost the same and many people use the terms interchangeably. However, quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen (the lightest of all compounds) it dominates even at room temperature. To perform a calculation at 0K (as opposed to a static crystal calculation), the strategy that Andrew Rosen proposed would still work if you use quantum statistics. For example, solving the vibrational problem within the harmonic approximation at the quantum mechanical level with give you the zero-point energy as the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. A good reference for hydrogen is this review article.\n* Although Andrew Rosen is correct in that the potential energy surface is largely temperature independent, there are a few situations in which the potential energy surface does vary significantly with temperature. An example of this is provided by many perovskite crystals (e.g. $\\ce{BaTiO_3}$), which undergo a series of temperature-induced structural phase transitions. For example, at very high temperatures the structure is cubic, and this structure sits at a minimum of the potential free energy surface. However, if you calculated the potential energy surface (instead of the free energy surface), then it has a double-well shape and the cubic structure is at the saddle point, so the structure will lower its energy by distorting and going to one of the minima. This is precisely what happens at low temperatures because the corresponding free energy surface acquires a double-well shape, and the system undergoes a structural phase transition. A good early DFT reference for this is this paper.\n* As already pointed out by others, the differences between DFT and TDDFT or $GW$-BSE are not related to the inclusion or exclusion of temperature. In this language, both TDDFT and $GW$-BSE have no temperature for the behaviour of the nuclei, and you could incoporate it in a similar fashion to what Andrew Rosen described for DFT.\n"

    "output": "Choosing bridal lingerie is one of the many exciting things you get to do as bride-to-be, and itâs something so personal that only you can do it. For lingerie that youâre planning to wear under your dress on your big day, youâll need to choose a style that works well under your specific dress. If youâre planning to get other lingerie to change into after the wedding, you have unlimited options with which you can surprise your fiancÃ©!\n\n## Find lingerie for your dress\n\n1. Go with a slip and shapewear if you have a sheath dress. Light flowing fabrics make beautiful wedding gowns but may require a little extra support underneath to avoid showing unwanted bulges or panty lines. Find shapewear that hides any problem areas, and a slip made from similar fabric as your gown in case your gown slips. To reduce the layers you need to wear, try a shaping slip in the same color as your dress.\n2. Choose high-waisted shaping lingerie for a mermaid dress. Mermaid dresses show off all your natural curves by hugging your body, so consider lingerie that draws in your waist and doesnât show panty lines. A high-waisted thong is a good option, on its own or coupled with a bustier.\n3. Find a bustier or corset for your ballgown. Many ballgown style dresses already have a structured corset or bustier in them, but if yours doesnât, find one that matches the color of your dress. Choose a bustier bra thatâs seamless and strapless to support and lift your bust while slimming your torso. Panties for your ballgown can be any style you choose, since a ballgown is loose in the skirt area and you wonât be able to see panty lines.\n4. Choose any lingerie for A-line dresses. A-line, or princess-style dresses, are fitted at the top and flow out below the bustline. If this is the type of dress you have, you can choose any lingerie based on your comfort or preference instead of shaping or support. Keep in mind the shape of the top of your dress when choosing a bra; if the dress has a deep neckline or is strapless, youâll want to find a strapless bra or skip a bra altogether.\n5. Find a backless bra with adhesive sides for a backless dress. If you have a halter or other type of backless dress, you may want support or coverage from your lingerie. Choose an adhesive bra that matches the color of your dress to get the support you need. Adhesive bras also work great for strapless dresses if you canât find a strapless bra that you like.\n6. Match the lingerie color to your dress. Try bringing a swatch of the fabric that your gown is made from with you when you shop for lingerie. Some bridal gown retailers offer a swatch so you can match accessories with your gown. If you donât have a sample of the fabric, try ordering more than one shade of lingerie and keep the one that best matches your gown. Matching your lingerie with your dress instead of your skin tone is helpful in case your gown slips a bit. Your lingerie wonât be as obvious if the shade matches your dress.\n\n\n## Choose wed night lingerie\n\n1. Wear whatever youâll feel sexy in. There are certain myths surrounding wedding night lingerie that it has to look a certain way, but only you and your fiancÃ© know what you like. This means if you donât want to wear white, donât! You can wear anything from boyfriend-style pajamas to French maid costumes, so donât be afraid to choose something unique to you.\n2. Choose flowery white lace for the classic feminine look. If you want to go a traditional route, find a comfortable white or cream bra and panty set made from sheer flowery lace. Or go with a short white lacy gown. Some lingerie combines lace and faux-fur for an extra feminine touch.\n3. Try an artsy corset with suspenders, stockings, and heels for a bolder approach. If bold is more your style, think straps! Look for a detailed, beaded or embroidered corset with suspenders, fishnet or lace thigh-highs, and a pair of matching heels. Choose any color theme you like for this lingerie based on your preference. Some corsets have a connected underwear component with suspenders; others donât, in which case, you can find a matching thong to complete your outfit.\n4. Choose a lacy jumpsuit or teddie if you like one-pieces. Find a lacy halter mini-shorts jumpsuit to combine sporty and feminine looks. Or go bold and feminine with a sheer or strappy teddie in any color that you like. To stay on the more traditional side, choose white or cream for your one-piece lingerie. Or choose a pastel pink or blue for a romantic, feminine effect. Black or red also work well with these pieces if you want a bolder look.\n5. Get a sheer dressing gown for some added luxury. Regardless of what style lingerie you get, consider a sheer dressing gown to drape over it, as an extra piece to remove on your wedding night, for lounging around in the morning, or both.\n6. Consider a separate registry just for lingerie if youâre having trouble deciding. If you like too many pieces to choose, let a few close friends and your fiancÃ© choose for you! Create a registry online with a lingerie store, add some of your favorite pieces, and give your bridesmaids and fiancÃ© the link before your bridal shower. This gives the people who know you best a chance to help you decide. You may end up with more than one item, but thatâs okay. Choose one for your wedding night and save the rest for your honeymoon!\n\n\n## Consider your body type\n\n1. Choose strappy lingerie on a muscular frame. You can probably pull off some pretty daring looks if youâre in good shape. Choose lingerie with lots of straps, bold colors, or a cinched waistline to show it off.\n2. Try a plunging neckline and briefs if youâre pear-shaped. Pear-shaped women are smaller up top with wider hips, butt, and thighs. Show off this type of figure with pieces that go low at the neckline and brief-style underwear. Or experiment with colors by wearing bold, bright patterns up top.\n3. Go with v-cut panties and a full coverage bra or corset if youâre apple-shaped. Apple-shaped ladies carry more weight in the top half of their bodies and have slender legs. Show off this type of body by providing full bust coverage and concealing your stomach area, if you want to. Think lots of lace up top and brightly colored panties.\n4. Try a garter belt or any waist-cincher for an hourglass figure. Hourglass figures have a proportioned build with bust and thigh measurements that are about equal, and are slimmer at the waist. Show off your waistline with a flattering belt or any accessory that draws attention to it.\n5. Go wireless for a small bust. If you donât need an underwire bra on your wedding day, donât bother with one. Try a feminine lacy bralette or a racerback style bra if you have a small chest. You can likely find some cute halter one-pieces as well.\n6. Choose high-waisted bottoms for a long torso. If you have a long torso and shorter legs, you can choose from the variety of high-waisted styles that are so popular. Try a lacy crop top set with high-waisted bottoms to draw more attention to your shoulders and legs.\n"

    "input": " What causes sleepwalking?",
    "output": "The cause of sleepwalking is unknown. A number of, as yet unproven, hypotheses are suggested for why it might occur, including: delay in the maturity of the central nervous system, increased slow wave sleep, sleep deprivation, fever, and excessive tiredness. There may be a genetic component to sleepwalking. One study found that sleepwalking occurred in 45% of children who have one parent who sleepwalked, and in 60% of children if both parents sleepwalked. Thus, heritable factors may predispose an individual to sleepwalking, but expression of the behavior may also be influenced by environmental factors.\n\nSleepwalking has been hypothesized to be linked to the neurotransmitter serotonin, which also appears to be metabolized differently in migraine patients and people with Tourette syndrome, both populations being four to nine times more likely to experience an episode of sleepwalking. Hormonal fluctuations have been found to contribute to sleepwalking episodes in women, with the likeliness to sleepwalk being higher before the onset of menstruation. It also appears that hormonal changes during pregnancy decrease the likelihood of engaging in sleepwalking."

    "output": "Learning a foreign language is an important skill that can open up countless opportunities and experiences. Whether for travel, work, or personal growth, knowing how to speak a second or third language is a valuable asset in todayâs increasingly globalized world. While it may sometimes seem like a daunting undertaking, there are several key strategies that can help make learning a new language easier and more effective.\n\nOne of the first steps in learning a foreign language is to set a goal. This could be something as simple as learning a few key phrases before a trip abroad or something more long term, such as achieving fluency in a language for work or personal reasons. Setting a goal provides a clear endpoint and motivation to keep going.\n\nOnce a goal has been established, itâs important to create a structured learning plan. This can include setting aside dedicated study time each day or week, focusing on specific aspects of the language (such as grammar or vocabulary), and setting measurable benchmarks to track progress. A learning plan keeps things organized and ensures that steady progress is being made toward the ultimate goal.\n\nImmersion is one of the best ways to learn a foreign language quickly and effectively. This can involve watching movies without subtitles, reading books in the target language, listening to podcasts, or even taking a trip to a foreign country. Immersive learning helps build confidence speaking the language and exposes learners to new words and concepts in a natural way.\n\nPracticing regularly is essential when learning a foreign language. This can take many forms, including talking to native speakers, practicing with flashcards, using online programs, or simply thinking in the target language. Practice reinforces what has already been learned and helps develop new skills. It also builds confidence, which is crucial for improving language ability.\n\nItâs important to remember that learning a foreign language takes time and practice. Donât get discouraged if progress seems slow - every little bit counts! With dedication and perseverance, anyone can become multilingual."

    "input": " What are some alternatives to wrapping gifts for holidays?",
    "output": "We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n"

    "input": " Write a guide for buying school supplies.",
    "output": "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you donât have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your childâs school. Donât rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isnât available on the schoolâs website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the schoolâs website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but itâs always a good idea to check the supply list in case your childâs teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks havenât gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldnât mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Donât worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. Thereâs no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time youâre shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"

    "input": " If I plug a cable into a switch and then plug another cable into the same switch, will the switch go crazy?",
    "output": "It depends on the router/switch. \nIf it's \"Managed\" - Like decent Netgear, Cisco or HP Procurve, or has STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) or one of its variants enabled, there's a few seconds of absolute insanity, then the switch realises that there's a loop in the network topology, and blocks one of the ports. \n(I've only described the STP re-convergence as \"absolute insanity\" because if you're using old-style, slow, STP then re-convergence can take 30s or more, depending on network complexity.  Vendor specific STP extensions such as BackboneFast and so on will decrease this, but you might still end up with a short period of a slightly unstable network. Rapid STP is a lot quicker to converge, due to a different algorithm)\nIf it's \"Unmanaged\"- Like pretty much all SOHO grade gear, and a fair proportion of small 4-8 port switches, then all hell breaks loose, as you've just created a loop in a network, and all the traffic tends to just bounce about inside the loop.  \nThe reason this happens is because switches rely on a process of MAC address learning to map MAC addresses to physical ports.  In a non-looped network,  one MAC address will only be visible to the switch on a given physical port.  If you have a loop, then the switch will see multiple paths to the same MAC address, and possibly multiple MAC addresses on multiple ports, so instead of the traffic being switched efficiently, it will be broadcast to wherever it sees the MACs.  This is known as a \"Broadcast Storm\".\nThis can quickly use up all of a switch's CPU power, fill the transmit and receive buffers, as well as polluting the MAC address table.\nBasically, if you create a loop in the network, you'll know about it, either through monitoring (detecting a change in the STP topology [you do have monitoring, right?]), or in everything falling over dramatically.   \nIf you look at a switch that has a broadcast storm on it, you tend to find that all of the port activity lights are blinking all at the same time."

    "input": " How does a hidden service work?",
    "output": "Up to at least October 2013 the hidden services work like this:\n\n* A hidden service calculates its key pair (private and public key, asymmetric encryption).\n* Then the hidden service picks some relays as its introduction points.\n* It tells its public key to those introduction points over Tor circuits.\n* After that the hidden-service creates a hidden service descriptor, containing its public key and what its introduction points are.\n* The hidden service signs the hidden service descriptor with its private key.\n* It then uploads the hidden service descriptor to a distributed hash table (DHT).\n* Clients learn the .onion address from a hidden service out-of-band. (e.g. public website) (A $hash.onion is a 16 character name derived from the service's public key.)\n* After retrieving the .onion address the client connects to the DHT and asks for that $hash.\n* If it exists the client learns about the hidden service's public key and its introduction points.\n* The client picks a relay at random to build a circuit to it, to tell it a one-time secret. The picked relay acts as rendezvous point.\n* The client creates a introduce message, containing the address of the rendezvous point and the one-time secret, before encrypting the message with the hidden service's public key.\n* The client sends its message over a Tor circuit to one of the introduction points, demanding it to be forwarded to the hidden service.\n* The hidden service decrypts the introduce message with its private key to learn about the rendezvous point and the one-time secret.\n* The hidden service creates a rendezvous message, containing the one-time secret and sends it over a circuit to the rendezvous point.\n* The rendezvous point tells the client that a connection was established.\n* Client and hidden service talk to each other over this rendezvous point. All traffic is end-to-end encrypted and the rendezvous point just relays it back and forth. Note that each of them, client and hidden service, build a circuit to the rendezvous point; at three hops per circuit this makes six hops in total.\n"

    "input": " Write a number based mind trick.",
    "output": "Amaze your friends and relatives with these number-based mind tricks. These three tricks are arranged from easiest to hardest (smallest numbers to biggest). Even young kids can do the simple number prediction trick.\n\n## Simple number prediction\n\n1. Set the trick up. Tell a friend that you are performing a math trick. You will ask her to do some calculations secretly, then read her mind for their answer.\n2. Write down your prediction. Pretend to think hard for a moment, then write down the number 3 on a piece of paper. Fold the paper in half, without letting anyone see the number.\n3. Ask your friend to write down a number between 1 and 20. She should pick this secretly and keep the piece of paper. We'll go through an example, where your friend secretly picks the number 4. This trick works with any number, but keeping it between 1 and 20 makes it less likely that your friend will make a mistake.\n4. Instruct her to add 1 to her number. Warn her not to give you any sign, not even moving her lips. All you need is your mental powers. For example, if she chose 4, her new number is 4 + 1 = 5.\n5. Tell your friend to double the new number. Have her take the last number she had, and multiply it by 2. 5 x 2 = 10.\n6. Have her add 4 more. Put your hands to your head and concentrate, then tell her to add 4 to her last answer. 10 + 4 = 14.\n7. Divide by 2. Tell her you almost have it, but the number is too big for you to see. Ask her to divide it by 2 to make it easier. 14 Ã· 2 = 7.\n8. Subtract the original number. Ask your friend to look at the piece of paper she used to remind herself what the original number was. Take the last answer she had and subtract that original number. 7 - 4 = 3.\n9. Show her your prediction. Tell her you've finally read her mind. Ask her to announce the last number she ended up with. Once she has, unfold your piece of paper and reveal the 3 you wrote down. No matter which number she started with, her answer will be 3.\n\n\n## Guess someone's age\n\n1. Tell someone you're going to find his age. Let him know you'll be using your mathematical mind-reading abilities. Give him a calculator if he doesn't want to do the calculations in his head. This trick won't be too impressive with close friends or classmates, since you probably already know their age. Pick someone at least 10 years old and no more than 99 years old.\n2. Ask him to multiply the first digit in his age by five. Remind him to do the math silently, to keep his age secret from you. For example, if he is 32 years old, he should take the 3 and multiply it by 5. The answer is 3 x 5 = 15.\n3. Add 4 to his answer. Tell him to add 4 to the answer he found. In our example, he would silently add 15 + 4 = 19.\n4. Tell him to double his answer. Now your subject should multiply his last answer by 2, and let you know when he's finished. If he's doing the math in his head, ask him \"Are you sure?\" since people are most likely to make a mistake on this step. 19 x 2 = 38.\n5. Have him add the second digit of his age. Next, the person you're \"mind reading\" adds the last number in his age. Tell him this is the last calculation he needs to do. Since the subject of our example is 32 years old, he would add 2 to his last answer. His last answer was 38, so he calculates 38 + 2 = 40.\n6. Ask for his last answer. Have him say the final number out loud, so you and everyone in the room can hear it.\n7. Subtract 8 and tell him his real age. Silently subtract 8 from the number he gave you. The answer is his age, which you should announce to the room. In our example, 40 - 8 = 32.\n8. Try some variations. If you perform this trick more than once, people might figure out how it works. Here are a couple variations to keep it mysterious:\n\t* Instead of adding 4 and later (secretly) subtracting 8, you can add 3 and subtract 6, or add 2 and subtract 4, or even add 25 and subtract 50. Just remember you'll need to subtract twice as much as the original number, because it got doubled in one of the later steps. To really switch it up, try this: double your age, add 2, multiply by 5, and subtract 10. You need both the doubling and multiplication by five to move the first digit of his age (3 in our example) to the tens place where it belongs (3 x 2 x 5 = 30).\n\n\n## Magical 37\n\n1. Hand a volunteer a pencil and paper. This one involves some three digit numbers, so most people will not want to do the math in their head. Warn the volunteer that he will need to do long division.\n2. Ask him to write the same digit 3 times. Tell him to hide the paper from you to prove you're not cheating. Ask him to write a 3-digit number that repeats the same digit three times. For example, he could write 222.\n3. Instruct him to add each digit together. Now your volunteer should treat each of the three digits as a separate number, and find their sum. For example, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n4. Tell him to divide the larger number by the smaller one. He should now take the 3-digit number, and divide it by the\\ smaller one. Give him some time to work this out. 222 / 6 = 37,\n5. Announce that his number is 37. As long as your volunteer followed the instructions correctly, his answer will always be 37.\n"

    "input": " What is kerning and letter spacing?",
    "output": "Any font has built-in spacing determined by the âside bearingâ of each character. In metal type, the side bearing is the physical right or left edge of the individual piece of type that determines its spacing from the characters on either side. Digital fonts mimic this in the basic design process.\n\n* âTo kernâ means to adjust the spacing between a pair of letters, numerals, punctuation, etc.  (properly âglyphsâ) so that their spacing looks correct. The letters AV, for example, have to overlap in any usual typeface, otherwise at least one of them ends up looking lost and bewildered. Their kerning is tightened to snug them up to one another. An italic f will collide with a following question or quote mark in some fonts, so the kerning must be opened up from the default spacing.\n\nAn ancient scribe could kern effortlessly with pen and ink, and if you read old manuscripts you'll see lots of places where a letter intrudes into the space of the one next to it. With metal type, it wasn't so easy. Kerning required cutting away some of the metal base, or table, of the character. The amount of time, skill and work involved is left as an exercise for readers whose minds are in need of a little boggling. The shapes of the letters in metal type intended for long passages of text such as books, or especially newspapers, were designed to minimize the amount of kerning that would be necessary.\n\nKerning tables built into a digital font assign preset kerning values to specific letter pairs, according to the designer's best estimate of how they should look. There can be a dozen or so pairs (or none!) in a cheapo font, thousands in a high-end one. No matter how thoroughly and well a kerning table is built, though, there will still be situations where some awkward combination requires that the kerning be loosened or tightened from the preset values of the glyphs.\n\n* Letter spacing (often âtrackingâ in software applications) adjusts the spacing between all the glyphs in a piece of text. This can help to make a page look a little more open and inviting, for example, especially with a similarly open leading. Very large type, such as a big headline, almost always benefits from tightening the tracking. Tiny type, such as in captions or footnotes, is made more readable by opening the letter spacing a bit, especially if the paper is absorbent and will allow the ink to spread a little.\n\nA final note: Use caution with both kerning and tracking. Tracking is very often wildly overdone, kerning is seldom done enough."

    "output": "Once upon a time, Death was the teeth that hunted us under a bright moon. We ran and we shivered, waving our little fire-sticks around.\nOnce we had settled, Death was the dry season that failed to end, the diseases that killed entire villages. She was famine and boils and warfare.\nWe grew a little bit and started thinking too much. Death became the emptiness behind words on paper, extinction of languages and passenger pigeons. Death became forgetfulness.\nSoon, we no longer needed to have five children to ensure that two would survive to adulthood. We conquered disease, destroyed warfare, filled our souls to the brim with knowing and still didn't understand anything.\nWe stand on the surface of the moon, or mars, or alpha centauri, and we look back at the single shimmering pixel that we emerged from. Death can't touch us, we who move between the stars, we who record all things and all memories. She is but a whisper in the void between stars.\nAnd the shimmering pixel turns bloated and red as its star engulfs our homeland. And we say, it does not matter, we are eternal. No longer can we feel the teeth that hunt us under a bright moon.\nBut still we run, like insects from disturbed grass. Flocking from one life-giving heat source to another, until they are all cold and gone. Death has not left us. She is still at our heels, waiting for us to falter, waiting for us to grow cold.\nEventually the whole universe will be hers."

    "input": " What is the error message?",
    "output": "The error message is due to the unfortunate fact that PHP will implicitly declare an unknown token as a constant string of the same name.\nThat is, it's trying to interpret this (note the missing quote marks): \n```$_POST[department]\n```\nThe only valid way this would be valid syntax in PHP is if there was previously a constant ```department``` defined.  So sadly, rather than dying with a Fatal error at this point, it issues this Notice and acts as though a constant had been defined with the same name and value:\n```// Implicit declaration of constant called department with value 'department'\ndefine('department', 'department');\n```\nThere are various ways you can get this error message, but they all have the same root cause - a token that could be a constant.\nStrings missing quotes:  ```$my_array[bad_key]```\nThis is what the problem is in your case, and it's because you've got string array keys that haven't been quoted.  Fixing the string keys will fix the bug:\nChange:\n```$department = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST[department]);\n...(etc)...\n```\nTo:\n```$department = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['department']);\n...(etc)...\n```\nVariable missing dollar sign: ```var_without_dollar```\nAnother reason you might see this error message is if you leave off the ```$``` from a variable, or ```$this->``` from a member.  Eg, either of the following would cause a similar error message:\n```my_local;   // should be $my_local\nmy_member;  // should be $this->my_member\n```\nInvalid character in variable name: ```$bad-variable-name```\nA similar but more subtle issue can result if you try to use a disallowed character in a  variable name - a hyphen (```-```) instead of an underscore ```_``` would be a common case.\nFor example, this is OK, since underscores are allowed in variable names:\n```if (123 === $my_var) {\n  do_something();\n}\n```\nBut this isn't:\n```if (123 === $my-var) {\n  do_something();\n}\n```\nIt'll be interpreted the same as this:\n```if (123 === $my - var) {  // variable $my minus constant 'var'\n  do_something();\n}\n```\nReferring to a class constant without specifying the class scope\nIn order to refer to a class constant you need to specify the class scope with ```::```, if you miss this off PHP will think you're talking about a global ```define()```.\nEg:\n```class MyClass {\n  const MY_CONST = 123;\n  public function my_method() {\n    return self::MY_CONST;  // This is fine\n  }\n  public function my_method() {\n    return MyClass::MY_CONST;  // This is fine\n  }\n  public function my_bad_method() {\n    return MY_CONST;  // BUG - need to specify class scope\n  }\n}\n```\nUsing a constant that's not defined in this version of PHP, or is defined in an extension that's not installed\nThere are some system-defined constants that only exist in newer versions of PHP, for example the mode option constants for ```round()``` such as ```PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN``` only exist in PHP 5.3 or later.\nSo if you tried to use this feature in PHP 5.2, say:\n```$rounded = round($my_var, 0, PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN);\n```\nYou'd get this error message:\n\n  Use of undefined constant PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN - assumed\n  'PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN' Warning (2): Wrong parameter count for round()\n"
